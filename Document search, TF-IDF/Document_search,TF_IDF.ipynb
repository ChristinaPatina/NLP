            "There was tantalisingly (and tellingly) little of Downey Jr speaking in the film’s trailer but just enough to threaten a film already beset by production issues – a title change, reshoots, and a postponed release date – with the heavy burden of an infamously bad accent. And now reviews have confirmed that his pronunciation is wayward, to say the least, with Vulture’s Bilge Ebiri describing it as “an ill-advised and half-hearted Welsh accent which occasionally (and I’m assuming inadvertently) slips into Irish, Indian and Jamaican intonations”.\n",

            "\n",
            "It seems like we’re more obsessed with analysing accents than ever before. Voice coach Erik Singer garners millions of views for his videos critiquing accents from Idris Elba to Daniel Day-Lewis to Cate Blanchett, while on the flip-side, there are some actors who assimilate so seamlessly, that the uproar comes when audiences hear them speak out of character. Killing Eve fans were shocked to hear Jodie Comer’s Liverpudlian accent in real-life after getting to know her as that show’s vocally chameleonic assassin Villanelle, who switches between Russian, French, Italian and German. And Christian Bale has played so many iconic roles using US accents – Patrick Bateman, Batman and Dick Cheney, to name a few – that audiences are often surprised to hear his own voice (he was born in Wales but grew up in England) when he gives interviews and awards speeches.\n",
            "\n",
            "Also, when done right, putting on an accent definitely offers a little bump to your award-season chances, as demonstrated this year by the likes of Florence Pugh and Saoirse Ronan convincingly relocating their respective British and Irish accents to 19th-Century Massachusetts for Little Women, or native Aussie Margot Robbie turning American in Bombshell and Once Upon a Time… in Hollywood.\n",

            "The key things to mastering an accent are courage, playfulness, a good ear, inventiveness, creativity and a real sensitivity – Joe Windley\n",
            "\n",
            "For Rada lead voice tutor Joe Windley, the keys to mastering an accent successfully are “courage, playfulness, a good ear, inventiveness, creativity and a real sensitivity to the diverse range of sounds that can be used in any given speech system” (and for what it’s worth, Jodie Comer is top of his list of most vocally-skilled stars). Meanwhile the real challenge for actors is being “able to manifest the speech in such a way that it serves clarity and maintains authenticity”.\n",
            "\n",
            "Classical acting training has traditionally focused on the voice being ‘whole’, meaning full of tone and fully articulate, but this is not how most people naturally speak. Recently, instead, there has been a contrasting obsession with authenticity, even though the specificity of an accent might only be noticeable to the community from which it comes. For example if the accents in Peaky Blinders sounded lightweight to locals, in the US they have proved convincingly alien enough that viewers have been switching on the subtitles. And trying to determine an ‘authentic’ accent for any particular country or region is not clear-cut: even when we speak in our own accent, it can vary significantly, as we code-switch depending on what context or to whom we are speaking.\n",
            "\n",
            "A truly bad accent has always had the capacity to derail a production, yanking audiences out of the moment as it becomes impossible to look – or should that be listen – past. But, more than that, dodgy accents can also be morally problematic, serving to reinforce stereotypes, as explored in Hari Kondabolu’s 2017 documentary The Problem With Apu.\n",

The problem of south Asian vocal caricaturing is also highlighted in Aziz Ansari’s Netflix comedy Master of None which features an episode titled Indians on TV, and deals with south Asian actors being asked to do stereotypical ‘Indian’ accents at auditions.\n",
            "\n",
            "No more ‘funny voices’\n",
            "\n",
            "Accents are absolutely part of the wider debate about representation in film and TV. The idea of an accent, particularly one of a different nationality to the actor, being just a ‘funny voice’ is increasingly unacceptable. When Ralph Fiennes was promoting The White Crow, his biopic of Rudolf Nureyev, he told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme of his decision to cast predominantly Russian actors: “I feel the days when English-speaking actors put on accents and told the world they were Russian or German or Swedish or Italian – those days are gone. One has read quite a lot of critical responses to films that are still doing that, where people go, ‘Haven’t we had enough?’ The landscape has shifted.”\n",
            "\n",
            "Additionally, the deployment of accents can still be reflective of classism, and domination by the middle-and-upper classes. As actress Rebecca Humphries points out, for example, regional British accents are still sometimes used as a punchline. Humphries, who has worked at the Donmar Warehouse, National Theatre Company and the Royal Shakespeare Company, is originally from Norfolk, and is currently filming a project playing an extremely posh character, with a dialect coach on set. As a working-class person, she is conscious not to mock the accent, but says that in Shakespeare, it can be the opposite, when a broad, regional, working-class accent is frequently used for comedic roles. “It does my utter head in,” she says. “To make it ‘funny’. It’s because there’s a class snobbery there that the thicker [accent you have], the funnier you are.”\n",
            "\n",
            "These days, actors have more reason to worry about getting their character’s chosen pronunciation right, however – for in 2020, film and television are not just available for consumption but for dissection. Screen-grabs and sound clips allow us to pore over performances for embarrassing mistakes, whether Quentin Tarantino’s misguided effort at Australian in Django Unchained (highlighting the perils of directing yourself) or Nicholas Cage’s Dolmio-esque Italian in Captain Corelli’s Mandolin.\n",
            "\n",
            "What we found very quickly is that actors will act accents. They will not act, they will act accents – Craig Mazin\n",
            "\n",
            "Hence the increasingly great lengths actors go to in order to nail an accent down. Scot Martin Compston stays in his London accent throughout the four months it takes to film a series of BBC cop drama Line of Duty. Booksmart actress Beanie Feldstein worked in a Wolverhampton shop to hone the Black Country accent necessary for her lead role in the upcoming film adaptation of Caitlin Moran’s best-selling novel How to Build a Girl. Meanwhile, for the forthcoming Ohio-set film Queen &amp; Slim, London-born Daniel Kaluuya worked at a Costco in Cleveland. As Humphries puts it: “The thing about theatre is that that performance is then gone. But on screen, that performance is around forever, and it’s within your interests not to f**k it up. People won’t forget it.”\n",
            "\n",
            "However, with all the scrutiny applied to getting accents right these days, another option that has crept in very recently is to forgo the challenge by ignoring ‘authenticity’ completely, and have actors simply perform in their native intonation. Such was the case with last year’s critically-acclaimed HBO series Chernobyl, which told the story of the 1985 Soviet nuclear disaster with a largely British cast speaking in various different varieties of British accent. “What we found very quickly is that actors will act accents,” said creator and script-writer Craig Mazin explaining the decision. “They will not act, they will act accents, and we were losing everything about these people that we loved... My hope is that the accent thing just fades away in seconds, and you stop caring about it.”\n",
            "\n",
            "What is ‘authentic’?\n",
            "\n",
            "Such a creative strategy may seem to offer a ‘backlash’ against authenticity, but perhaps it’s more about the creators concentrating on being authentic to the essence of the story, rather than every tiny detail. Another example of this approach can be found in Armando Iannucci’s The Death of Stalin, where Soviet officials have accents from Brooklyn, Yorkshire and the East End. Humphries says that this option of abandoning accuracy is also becoming more common in theatre: “For a really long time, things needed to be quite rigid and firmly in place, and now there’s this real fluidity... If [the performance] is really good then the only people who are moaning about [accuracy] tend to be old-school purists and they’re just quite boring.”\n",
            "\n",
            "You’ve got to pump yourself full of all this knowledge about how to stand, how to speak, so that once you’re on set, with any luck, it’ll be in your body and your voice – Rebecca Humphries\n",
            "\n",
            "However if you are going to put a different voice on, in order to avoid Mazin’s concern of “acting accents”, Humphries says that the key is to get to a point of feeling physically at ease. “The idea being that you’ve got to pump yourself full of all this knowledge about how to stand, how to speak, so that once you’re on set, with any luck, it’ll be in your body and your voice so that you can do the acting and the reacting – the good stuff.”\n",
            "\n",
            "But that process is a luxury rarely afforded to many shows, when time is short and performers have tight schedules as they move between jobs. Actor Charlie Allen explains that in theatre, there is often more of an opportunity to perfect an accent. “If you’re doing film and TV, you’re essentially kind of on your own before you turn up on set, and you’re not necessarily getting the feedback or guidance that you would do if you were in the theatre rehearsal room.”\n",
            "\n",
            "Brighton-born Allen has direct experience of this, facing the same challenge as the Peaky Blinders cast recently when playing a Brummie character in new play, Skin in the Game by Paul Westwood. Even more dauntingly, one performance actually took place in a community centre at the foot of the Birmingham high-rise block of flats in which the play is set. In contrast to Peaky Blinders, though, the accents went down well: “I think I cheated a little bit because I actually have family from Birmingham,” Allen says. “Saying that, it’s one thing speaking to your family and speaking in your own natural rhythm [and another] when you’re picking up somebody’s play script and all of a sudden you have very specific things to say. And it was quite easy to tip over into Liverpudlian or Scouse, which we hadn’t even considered at all.”\n",
            "\n",
            "To fudge or not to fudge?\n",
            "\n",
            "However, although people might profess to crave authenticity, meticulous accuracy isn’t always helpful – or at least considered financially judicious. Often an accent can be historically accurate, while also being seen as alienating to a mass audience by the moneymen. For example, Chris Pine was mostly praised for his Scottish accent as Robert the Bruce in Netflix’s Outlaw King, but in real life, the 14th-Century Scotsman would probably have been speaking French. It isn’t surprising that producers decided to forgo the confusion that would inevitably have arisen from making him a Francophone.\n",
            "\n",
            "Sometimes, either the producers or the actors themselves decide that a fudged accent, resting loosely in the vicinity of the correct pronunciation, might be the sweetest, and certainly the safest, spot for the widest possible audience to understand. The US Deep South is particularly at risk: Reese Witherspoon in Sweet Home Alabama, Julia Roberts in Charlie Wilson’s War and those of The Walking Dead cast who aren’t originally from Georgia have all been called out for being generically Southern, rather than specific to the states in which they’re set.\n",
            "\n",
            "However Windley disagrees with such fudging. “If you’re going to set it in a particular place, you really are duty bound, I think, to find the authenticity of that place,” he says. “But that doesn’t mean to say you can only cast actors who come from there.” He prefers to talk about “speech systems” rather than accents or dialects, which he finds “problematic” terminology that fails to take in the diversity of human speech, or to acknowledge how voices are informed by age, gender, time and cultural context. The way we speak, he says, is “a living force. It’s not an external piece of clothing that you stick on from the outside”.\n",
            "\n",
            "Accents are not just about the voice. The accent can make you hold your head differently – Ania Marson\n",
            "\n",
            "He continues: “If you just study a speech system without fully exploring the context, and then you put it over the top of a situation, it will come over as phoney.” In short, getting an accent right is a lot more complicated, say, than simply shortening a few vowel sounds and calling everyone ‘duckie’. An accent needs to be embedded into the context of the story, rather than floating around on top of the performance, connected to nothing.\n",
            "\n",
            "Actress Ania Marson agrees. She has been acting for almost six decades, most recently appearing in Killing Eve, The Alienist and Britannia. “Accents are not just about the voice,” she says. “The accent can make you hold your head differently. Your whole mouth changes in order to incorporate that, so there’s a kind of physicality that takes over which is fascinating. If you’re doing it in the right way, you sort of morph into a different person.”\n",
            "\n",
            "There are some accents in film and TV history that are almost unanimously accepted as terrible, whether because they wander like the critically panned Keanu Reeves in Bram Stoker’s Dracula, whose attempt at a posh London accent does abominable things to vowels – or because the choice doesn’t ring true, like Angelina Jolie opting for a Russian-ish inflection despite Alexander’s Ancient Greek setting. Others are polarising: whether or not Robert Pattinson’s Monty-Python-esque take on the Dauphin in Netflix’s The King works probably depends on whether you thought his camply exaggerated French accent was hilarious or hideous.\n",
            "\n",
            "But how we judge accents often comes down to a subjective decision about how important we think authenticity is in any particular instance. What is crucial is that we believe the stories we are watching, and that belief comes from somewhere considerably more inscrutable than what country, region or state a character sounds like they’re from.\n",
            "\n",
            "However, considering all the potential risks that come with attempting an accent, it does seem worth asking the question, is it absolutely necessary to try putting one on in the first place? Dr Dolittle is not, of course, a real person, and authenticity is probably not the most important element in a story about talking animals. Having said that, given that Robert Downey Jr’s voice still seems to the least believable part of it, producers might be wishing that he’d stuck with his native New York tongue – or at least plumped for London, given his previous experience playing Sherlock Holmes.\n",

            "\n",
            "It's a figure that came from Prof Chris Dickman, an expert on Australian biodiversity at the University of Sydney.\n",
            "\n",
            "He released a statement explaining how he had reached the figure - a statement which refers to the number of animals affected rather than those necessarily dying as a direct result of the fire (although the title of the release talks about 480 million being killed).\n",
            "\n",
            "The numbers are based on a report he co-wrote in 2007 for the World Wide Fund for Nature (WWF) on the impact of land-clearing on Australian wildlife in New South Wales.\n",
            "\n",
            "It estimated that there were an average of 17.5 mammals, 20.7 birds and 129.5 reptiles per hectare (10,000 square metres, so a square 100m on each side - about the size of a rugby pitch).\n",

            "\n",
            "Also, the three million hectares figure is somewhat out of date - the fires have spread since then. So it is likely that more animals have been affected than the estimate suggests.\n",
            "\n",
            "But it is important to remember that this is just an estimate - its authors say the numbers are deliberately conservative. The figure for the number of reptiles is particularly uncertain, and reptiles make up three-quarters of the animals affected in these calculations.\n",
            "\n",
            "\"Density estimates are not available for many species, so they have had to be estimated from known densities of other species,\" Tom Oliver, professor of applied ecology at University of Reading, told Reality Check.\n",

            "\"For reptiles, there are no density estimates of individual species at all, just an estimate from a single study (Ehmann and Cogger 1985), which estimates 10 individuals per species per hectare.\"\n",
            "\n",
            "Colin Beale added: \"Although it is hard to find estimates of how well reptiles survive fires, in similar areas of Australia the majority of these reptiles live in the soil.\"\n",

Huawei has denied this and had hoped that if the US-China relationship improved, its fortunes would too.\n",
            "\n",
            "Analysts tell me that's unlikely. With the signing of this agreement, there's a clear separation between national security and trade, and Huawei and other Chinese companies should still expect the pressure on them to continue. So expect more American export bans not just on Huawei, but on several more Chinese companies and increased US scrutiny on Chinese investments abroad.\n",

            "China had already publicly said that it was opening up its financial services sector, and has recently allowed foreign companies to have a bigger stake in Chinese firms.

            "\n",
            "Even if US payment firms do have greater market access to the Chinese market, it's hard to see how they might be able to compete. Whether China sincerely applies its commitments to treat foreign and domestic firms equally will also be watched closely by the Trump administration, and this could be a potential area where the rapprochement could be derailed.\n",

            "\"But the more I zeroed in on what the film was, [I realised] it wasn't a Megyn Kelly biopic, it's about a year-and-a-half at Fox, and she was a part of many other women who experienced this thing and then ultimately succeeded in doing something that was thought of as impossible.\n",
            "\n",

            "\n",
            "Solar energy radiating back to space from the Earth's surface is absorbed by greenhouse gases and re-emitted in all directions.\n",

            "\n",
            "Most man-made emissions of CO2 come from burning fossil fuels. When carbon-absorbing forests are cut down and left to rot, or burned, that stored carbon is released, contributing to global warming.\n",

            "If you fly regularly, replacing flying with other forms of transport may have a bigger impact on your carbon footprint than changing your diet. A passenger's carbon footprint from a one-way flight from London to New York is just under half a tonne of greenhouse gases. Switching from a regular petrol vehicle to an electric car could save more than double that over a year.\n",

            "\n",
            "University of Oxford researcher Joseph Poore, and Thomas Nemecek of the Agroecology and Environment Research Division in Zurich, Switzerland, looked at the environmental impact of 40 major food products that represent the vast majority of what is eaten globally.\n",
            "\n",
            "They assessed the effect of these foods on climate-warming greenhouse gas emissions and the amount of land and fresh water used across all stages of their production, including processing, packaging, and transportation, but excluding the cooking process.\n",
            "\n",
            "By analysing data from nearly 40,000 farms, 1,600 processors, packaging types and retailers, Poore and Nemecek were able to assess how different production practices and geographies have very different consequences on the planet.\n",

            "\n",

            "\n",
            "For this story, these were converted to impact per serving sizes based on serving sizes from the British Dietetic Association (BDA) and healthy diet portion sizes from BUPA.\n",
            "\n",
            "The figures for serving sizes based on the BDA and BUPA suggestions are often lower than portion sizes commonly found in restaurants and what people normally expect, so the figures returned by the calculator on the impact of individuals' consumption are likely to be higher in reality.\n",
            "\n",
            "Protein-rich foods were calculated using the impact per 100g of protein from Poore and Nemecek's research and data on protein per serving from the BDA, to avoid differences between cooked and uncooked foods.\n",

            "\n",
            "These are then compared with the emissions of other daily habits. The European Environment Agency estimates that driving a regular petrol car produces 392g of CO2eq/mile over its entire lifecycle, including emissions from the vehicle's production, fuel production and exhaust emissions per mile.\n",
            "\n",
            "Heating the average UK home produces 2.34 tonnes of CO2eq annually, according to data from the Committee on Climate Change, and a passenger's carbon footprint for a return flight from London to Malaga is 320kg CO2eq, based on figures from the Carbon Neutral calculator.\n",

            "\n",
            "Warning: Some readers may find this story disturbing\n",
            "\n",
            "When I was a child I dreamed of becoming a vet. I imagined myself playing with mischievous puppies, calming down frightened kittens, and - as I was a countryside kid - performing check-ups on the local farm animals if they felt under the weather.\n",
            "\n",
            "It was a pretty idyllic life that I dreamt up for myself - but it's not quite how things worked out. Instead, I ended up working in a slaughterhouse.\n",
            "\n",
            "I was there for six years and, far from spending my days making poorly cows feel better, I was in charge of ensuring about 250 of them were killed every day.\n",
            "\n",
            "Whether they eat meat or not, most people in the UK have never been inside an abattoir - and for good reason. They are filthy, dirty places. There's animal faeces on the floor, you see and smell the guts, and the walls are covered in blood.\n",
            "\n",
            "And the smell... It hits you like a wall when you first enter, and then hangs thick in the air around you. The odour of dying animals surrounds you like a vapour.\n",
            "\n",
            "Why would anybody choose to visit, let alone work in a place like this?\n",
            "\n",
            "For me, it was because I'd already spent a couple of decades working in the food industry - in ready-meal factories and the like. So when I got an offer from an abattoir to be a quality control manager, working directly with the slaughtermen, it felt like a fairly innocuous job move. I was in my 40s at the time.\n",
            "\n",
            "On my first day, they gave me a tour of the premises, explained how everything worked and, most importantly, asked me pointedly and repeatedly if I was OK. It was quite common for people to faint during the tour, they explained, and the physical safety of visitors and new starters was very important to them. I was OK, I think. I felt sick, but I thought I'd get used to it.\n",
            "\n",
            "Soon, though, I realised there was no point pretending that it was just another job. I'm sure not all abattoirs are the same but mine was a brutal, dangerous place to work. There were countless occasions when, despite following all of the procedures for stunning, slaughterers would get kicked by a massive, spasming cow as they hoisted it up to the machine for slaughter. Similarly, cows being brought in would get scared and panic, which was pretty terrifying for all of us too. You'll know if you've ever stood next to one that they are huge animals.\n",
            "\n",
            "Personally, I didn't suffer physical injuries, but the place affected my mind.\n",
            "\n",
            "As I spent day after day in that large, windowless box, my chest felt increasingly heavy and a grey fog descended over me. At night, my mind would taunt me with nightmares, replaying some of the horrors I'd witnessed throughout the day.\n",
            "\n",
            "One skill that you master while working at an abattoir is disassociation. You learn to become numb to death and to suffering. Instead of thinking about cows as entire beings, you separate them into their saleable, edible body parts. It doesn't just make the job easier - it's necessary for survival.\n",
            "\n",
            "There are things, though, that have the power to shatter the numbness. For me, it was the heads.\n",
            "\n",
            "At the end of the slaughter line there was a huge skip, and it was filled with hundreds of cows' heads. Each one of them had been flayed, with all of the saleable flesh removed. But one thing was still attached - their eyeballs.\n",
            "\n",
            "Whenever I walked past that skip, I couldn't help but feel like I had hundreds of pairs of eyes watching me. Some of them were accusing, knowing that I'd participated in their deaths. Others seemed to be pleading, as if there were some way I could go back in time and save them. It was disgusting, terrifying and heart-breaking, all at the same time. It made me feel guilty. The first time I saw those heads, it took all of my strength not to vomit.\n",
            "\n",
            "I know things like this bothered the other workers, too. I'll never forget the day, after I'd been at the abattoir for a few months, when one of the lads cut into a freshly killed cow to gut her - and out fell the foetus of a calf. She was pregnant. He immediately started shouting and throwing his arms about.\n",
            "\n",
            "I took him into a meeting room to calm him down - and all he could say was, \"It's just not right, it's not right,\" over and over again. These were hard men, and they rarely showed any emotion. But I could see tears prickling his eyes.\n",
            "\n",
            "Even worse than pregnant cows, though, were the young calves we sometimes had to kill.\n",

            "\n",

            "Meat processing in the UK employs about 75,000 people of whom approximately 69% are from other European Union member states, the BMPA notes.\n",
            "\n",
            "\"The barrier to British people taking up roles in meat processing is an unwillingness to work in what is perceived to be a challenging environment,\" it says. \"Most people, while they eat meat, find it difficult to work in its production partly because of the obvious aversion to the slaughter process but also because it is a physically demanding role.\"\n",
            "\n",
            "At the height of the BSE and bovine tuberculosis crises in the 1990s, whole herds of animals had to be slaughtered. I worked at the slaughterhouse after 2010, so well after the BSE crisis, but if an animal tested positive for TB or BSE they would still bring the entire herd in to be culled - bulls, heifers and calves. I remember one day in particular, when I'd been there for about a year or so, when we had to slaughter five calves at the same time.\n",
            "\n",
            "We tried to keep them within the rails of the pens, but they were so small and bony that they could easily skip out and trot around, slightly wobbly on their newly born legs. They sniffed us, like puppies, because they were young and curious. Some of the boys and I stroked them, and they suckled our fingers.\n",
            "\n",
            "When the time came to kill them, it was tough, both emotionally and physically. Slaughterhouses are designed for slaughtering really large animals, so the stun boxes are normally just about the right size to hold a cow that weighs about a tonne. When we put the first calf in, it only came about a quarter of a way up the box, if that. We put all five calves in at once. Then we killed them.\n",

Nobody talked about their feelings; there was an overwhelming sense that you weren't allowed to show weakness. Plus, there were a lot of workers who wouldn't have been able to talk about their feelings to the rest of us even if they'd wanted to. Many were migrant workers, predominantly from Eastern Europe, whose English wasn't good enough for them to seek help if they were struggling.\n",

Some developed alcohol problems, often coming into work smelling strongly of drink. Others became addicted to energy drinks, and more than one had a heart attack. These drinks were then removed from the abattoir vending machines, but people would still bring them in from home and drink them secretly in their cars.\n",

Either way, I could never open up to people about the effect it was having on me. Instead I sometimes joked along with them, telling gory tales about skinning a cow or handling its innards. But mostly I just kept quiet.\n",

He was a bit of a joker, so people assumed he was taking the mick, saying he'd have a new job or something. But it made me feel really uneasy. I took him into a side room and asked him what he meant, and he broke down. He admitted that he was plagued by suicidal thoughts, that he didn't feel like he could cope any more, and that he needed help - but he begged me not to tell our bosses.\n",

In 2007, floods in the city led to two deaths and hundreds of evacuations. After that, £20m was spent on a flood-defence scheme in the Don Valley near the city, which Ian Rotherham agrees contributed to Fishlake's problems.\n",

            "Splitting water molecules into hydrogen used a lot of energy which usually came from fossil fuel sources.\n",
            "\n",
            "However, the widespread availability of renewable energy and improvements in electrolysis - the chemical process of separating elements using electricity - have brought down the financial and environmental cost of producing hydrogen for fuel.\n",

            "When tennis player Dalila Jakupovic was unable to complete her qualifying match for the Australia Open, which begins on Monday, she blamed the \"unhealthy\" air quality caused by fire smoke. Bushfires have been burning across Australia for weeks, causing air pollution which can be harmful to health.\n",
            "\n",
            "Ms Jakupovic criticised the organisers for letting the match go ahead in those conditions, as she and several other tennis players experienced effects, including coughing and difficulty breathing, nausea and muscle cramps.\n",

            "\n",
            "Breathing in smoke can cause irritation in the eyes, nose, throat and lungs. In more serious cases it can lead to hospital, especially for people with pre-existing respiratory conditions.\n",
            "\n",
            "As trees, leaves and other ground vegetation burn, they release small particles of solid carbon, water vapour and gases including carbon monoxide.\n",
            "\n",
            "Ultrafine particles of less than 2.5 micrometers - referred to as PM2.5 - pose the biggest risk to health because they can bury deep into the lungs and even enter the blood stream. This risks irritation, infection and an increased chance of heart attacks and lung disease.\n",
            "\n",
            "Professor Francesca Dominici, a statistician who works on public health, conducted a recent study into the effects of exposure to particulate matter. She found it was linked to hospital admissions for a wider range of conditions than previously thought.\n",
            "\n",
            "As well as the known effects on the lungs and heart, her team identified \"new diseases including septicaemia which is a serious bloodstream infection... urinary tract infections and renal failure,\" she told ABC News.\n",

            "Bushfire pollution does not typically do as much lasting damage as traffic or industry pollution, according to Associate Prof Brian Oliver, an expert in respiratory disease from the University of Technology, Sydney, because conditions often lift with a change in weather.\n",
            "\n",
            "This means any breathing discomfort is mostly short-lived.\n",

            "That has led to a 10% rise in hospital admissions, say officials. Paramedics have treated hundreds of people for breathing problems.\n",

            "Adelaide - a city of 1.3 million - was also affected last month, with its residents told to stay indoors.\n",
            "\n",
            "Because PM2.5 particles found in bushfire smoke are so small - a ninth of the size of a grain of sand - they can travel huge distances on the wind, potentially affecting many more people. The smoke is expected to make \"at least one full circuit around the globe,\" according to the US space agency Nasa.\n",
            "\n",
            "Most vulnerable are children, the elderly and smokers, while those with asthma, heart and lung problems can see exacerbated symptoms - such as chest tightness and difficulty breathing.\n",
            "\n",
            "And, as competitors in the Australia Open tennis tournament have experienced, athletes can be more susceptible to smoke damage because they are breathing in larger volumes of air as they exercise.\n",

            "The more intense the exercise, the more extra air will be taken in.\n",
            "\n",

            "\"Harris often has been ridiculed for not being an ambassador, but a governor-general,\" the paper added.\n",

            "\n",
            "It is 100 years to the day since Prohibition came into effect. The 18th Amendment to the Constitution banned anyone in the US from selling, making, importing or even transporting alcohol.\n",
            "\n",
            "Criminal gangs immediately took over the industry. Speakeasies sprung up nationwide to sell illegal liquor and tens of millions flouted the legislation.\n",
            "\n",
            "By 1933 it had been repealed - the only instance when a constitutional amendment has been overturned in this way.\n",
            "\n",
            "Prohibition is now viewed as a failure. No major political parties or organisations support its return, and there is little public support for such an extreme response in the future.\n",
            "\n",
            "But alcohol remains controversial in the US. The drinking age of 21 is higher than in other nations where drinking is legal. Dry counties and dry towns - where alcohol sales are restricted or barred outright - are dotted throughout the country. And Gallup polling from last year shows that nearly one fifth of respondents said drinking alcohol was \"morally wrong\".\n",
            "\n",
            "A century on, a small group of Americans are fighting to keep the dream of the so-called \"noble experiment\" alive.\n",
            "\n",
            "\"You should think of the Prohibition Party as an exercise in living history,\" says Jim Hedges, treasurer to the party, which is the third-oldest in the US.\n",
            "\n",
            "\"We're trying to keep the concept alive and the history alive,\" he tells the BBC. \"But as far as getting big enough to have influence, it's not going to happen any time soon.\"\n",
            "\n",
            "The US temperance movement, which sought to control or even ban alcohol sales, developed through the 19th Century. Campaigners focused on the perceived immorality of drinking as well as the health effects. Religious groups like Methodists and later organisations like the Anti-Saloon League helped bring about the law change.\n",
            "\n",
            "Dr Julia Guarneri, senior lecturer in US history at the University of Cambridge, tells the BBC that women's groups - in particular the Woman's Christian Temperance Union (WCTU) - were vital in bringing about prohibition.\n",
            "\n",
            "\"They thought alcohol was one way that money went from the employer to the employee to the saloon, and never reached the family,\" Dr Guarneri says. Women and children were also victims of abuse from alcoholic husbands and fathers.\n",

            "Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Women's groups across the country - like the women of Madison, Minnesota - fought for prohibition\n",
            "\n",
            "As reformers pushed for women's right to vote - ratified in the 19th Amendment, which was officially adopted just eight months after Prohibition took effect - women activists also sought to ban alcohol, seeing it as another way that women were oppressed in society.\n",
            "\n",
            "\"There's more of a connect between those two pieces of legislation than you might think,\" Dr Guarneri says. \"The WCTU saw the banning of alcohol as a way both to keep families happier and healthier, and women happier and healthier.\"\n",
            "\n",
            "Worries about the large numbers of immigrants coming to US shores at the end of the 19th and early 20th Centuries - in particular Catholics and Jews travelling from southern and eastern Europe - were another factor.\n",
            "\n",
            "Some European Catholics in particular brought a beer-drinking culture to the US which was alien to its Protestant populations. But on top of this, both Catholics and Jews incorporate alcohol in their religious rituals. While these ceremonies were still allowed during prohibition, Dr Guarneri says that alcohol \"became a way to police and oppress those immigrant populations\".\n",
            "\n",
            "The start of World War I further helped the temperance movement. Campaigners won support arguing that grains should be used for food rather than for beer during the conflict, while German immigrants or their descendants owned many of the breweries.\n",
            "\n",
            "\"So it was very easy to paint a portrait of alcohol being un-American,\" Dr Guarneri says. \"You name it - Pabst, Schlitz, Budweiser... there wasn't going to be a lot of public sympathy for the owners of the breweries from the US.\"\n",
            "\n",
            "But Prohibition was widely flouted. Many Americans, particularly the wealthy and the privileged, dodged the law with ease. President Warren Harding is said to have openly served alcohol confiscated by his government at the White House.\n",

            "Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Alcohol proved to be more popular than temperance campaigners believed\n",
            "\n",
            "The law grew more and more unpopular. Politicians also missed the tax revenue from alcohol sales after the Wall Street Crash of 1929. Franklin Roosevelt promised to repeal the measure in his bid for the presidency in 1932, and within a year of him coming to office, national prohibition was dead.\n",
            "\n",
            "Sarah Ward, former president of the WCTU, tells the BBC that Prohibition \"probably did our organisation more harm than good after the repeal\".\n",
            "\n",
            "To join the WCTU, applicants must pledge to avoid alcohol and pay membership dues. Ms Ward signed up as a teenager in the 1950s, and has kept that pledge to this day.\n",
            "\n",
            "She spent decades teaching people about the health impact of alcohol, and says she is proud of that work. But she said the current state of the temperance movement in the US was \"very discouraging\".\n",
            "\n",
            "\"We can always hope that somebody will realise and a corner will be turned and that'll be great if it happens,\" Ms Ward says - although she thinks members of the WCTU are \"more realistic\" now.\n",
            "\n",
            "\"Today, as far as Prohibition is concerned, we will have that when each individual makes the choice that that is the best way for them to live,\" she said. \"We can't get restrictions on anything. Everybody wants to be free and do their own thing.\"\n",

Mr Hedges was the party's presidential candidate in 2016 when they took just 5,600 votes nationwide - albeit far more than the 518 they won in 2012, and their best result since 1988. He says the party would like to see a \"sea change\" of public opinion to allow the return of national prohibition.\n",
            "\n",

            "   Just outside the remote Russian village of Dargavs lies a medieval necropolis fittingly called the “City of the Dead”. This ancient burial ground holds the remains of more than 10,000 people – many of whom lie eternally with their clothes and belongings – and some locals believe that anyone who dares to enter won’t return alive. While much mystery surrounds this graveyard located just over the border from Georgia (even the date of its construction is still just an estimate) historians are gradually unravelling its full story.\n",
            "\n",
            "Since the 16th Century, this remote stretch of southern Russian farmland has been used as a burial ground; its origins, though, are still unclear. One theory is that when territory was scarce during the 13th-Century Mongol-Tatar invasion, locals living in this 17km valley of the Caucasus mountains began to create similarly structured above-ground crypts to conserve space. Another theory suggests that the City of the Dead was created following the Indo-Iranian tradition established by the migrating Sarmatians who settled in southern Russia and buried their dead above ground to respect the land.\n",
            "\n",
            "Today, the site comprises 99 remarkably conserved medieval curved-roof crypts with single windows, and contains more than 100 bodies. Some are so well preserved that flesh is still attached to their bones.\n",
            "\n",
            "This media cannot be played on your device.\n",
            "\n",
            "The City of the Dead’s story also incorporates another piece of the region’s history: a series of plague epidemics in the 17th and 18th Centuries. There is evidence that infected residents quarantined themselves in the crypts as they waited for death to approach. Some bodies inside the crypts are also buried inside wooden coffins that resemble boats, and one corpse was even discovered with an oar next to it. With no navigable rivers nearby, some historians think ancient residents believed that one must cross a river to reach heaven.\n",
            "\n",
            "While many visitors travel to this 1.5-hectare cemetery to see remarkably well-preserved medieval architecture, historian Luidmila Gaboeva believes they come away with something more. “The people who come here in awe of the beauty of this place achieve peace with the eternal fear of death,” she said.\n",

And now reviews have confirmed that his pronunciation is wayward, to say the least, with Vulture’s Bilge Ebiri describing it as “an ill-advised and half-hearted Welsh accent which occasionally (and I’m assuming inadvertently) slips into Irish, Indian and Jamaican intonations”.\n",

            "It seems like we’re more obsessed with analysing accents than ever before. Voice coach Erik Singer garners millions of views for his videos critiquing accents from Idris Elba to Daniel Day-Lewis to Cate Blanchett, while on the flip-side, there are some actors who assimilate so seamlessly, that the uproar comes when audiences hear them speak out of character. Killing Eve fans were shocked to hear Jodie Comer’s Liverpudlian accent in real-life after getting to know her as that show’s vocally chameleonic assassin Villanelle, who switches between Russian, French, Italian and German. And Christian Bale has played so many iconic roles using US accents – Patrick Bateman, Batman and Dick Cheney, to name a few – that audiences are often surprised to hear his own voice (he was born in Wales but grew up in England) when he gives interviews and awards speeches.\n",
            "\n",
            "Also, when done right, putting on an accent definitely offers a little bump to your award-season chances, as demonstrated this year by the likes of Florence Pugh and Saoirse Ronan convincingly relocating their respective British and Irish accents to 19th-Century Massachusetts for Little Women, or native Aussie Margot Robbie turning American in Bombshell and Once Upon a Time… in Hollywood.\n",

            "The key things to mastering an accent are courage, playfulness, a good ear, inventiveness, creativity and a real sensitivity – Joe Windley\n",
            "\n",
            "For Rada lead voice tutor Joe Windley, the keys to mastering an accent successfully are “courage, playfulness, a good ear, inventiveness, creativity and a real sensitivity to the diverse range of sounds that can be used in any given speech system” (and for what it’s worth, Jodie Comer is top of his list of most vocally-skilled stars). Meanwhile the real challenge for actors is being “able to manifest the speech in such a way that it serves clarity and maintains authenticity”.\n",
            "\n",
            "Classical acting training has traditionally focused on the voice being ‘whole’, meaning full of tone and fully articulate, but this is not how most people naturally speak. Recently, instead, there has been a contrasting obsession with authenticity, even though the specificity of an accent might only be noticeable to the community from which it comes. For example if the accents in Peaky Blinders sounded lightweight to locals, in the US they have proved convincingly alien enough that viewers have been switching on the subtitles. And trying to determine an ‘authentic’ accent for any particular country or region is not clear-cut: even when we speak in our own accent, it can vary significantly, as we code-switch depending on what context or to whom we are speaking.\n",
            "\n",
            "A truly bad accent has always had the capacity to derail a production, yanking audiences out of the moment as it becomes impossible to look – or should that be listen – past. But, more than that, dodgy accents can also be morally problematic, serving to reinforce stereotypes, as explored in Hari Kondabolu’s 2017 documentary The Problem With Apu.\n",

The problem of south Asian vocal caricaturing is also highlighted in Aziz Ansari’s Netflix comedy Master of None which features an episode titled Indians on TV, and deals with south Asian actors being asked to do stereotypical ‘Indian’ accents at auditions.\n",

            "\n",
            "Accents are absolutely part of the wider debate about representation in film and TV. The idea of an accent, particularly one of a different nationality to the actor, being just a ‘funny voice’ is increasingly unacceptable. When Ralph Fiennes was promoting The White Crow, his biopic of Rudolf Nureyev, he told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme of his decision to cast predominantly Russian actors: “I feel the days when English-speaking actors put on accents and told the world they were Russian or German or Swedish or Italian – those days are gone. One has read quite a lot of critical responses to films that are still doing that, where people go, ‘Haven’t we had enough?’ The landscape has shifted.”\n",
            "\n",
            "Additionally, the deployment of accents can still be reflective of classism, and domination by the middle-and-upper classes. As actress Rebecca Humphries points out, for example, regional British accents are still sometimes used as a punchline. Humphries, who has worked at the Donmar Warehouse, National Theatre Company and the Royal Shakespeare Company, is originally from Norfolk, and is currently filming a project playing an extremely posh character, with a dialect coach on set. As a working-class person, she is conscious not to mock the accent, but says that in Shakespeare, it can be the opposite, when a broad, regional, working-class accent is frequently used for comedic roles. “It does my utter head in,” she says. “To make it ‘funny’. It’s because there’s a class snobbery there that the thicker [accent you have], the funnier you are.”\n",

            "These days, actors have more reason to worry about getting their character’s chosen pronunciation right, however – for in 2020, film and television are not just available for consumption but for dissection. Screen-grabs and sound clips allow us to pore over performances for embarrassing mistakes, whether Quentin Tarantino’s misguided effort at Australian in Django Unchained (highlighting the perils of directing yourself) or Nicholas Cage’s Dolmio-esque Italian in Captain Corelli’s Mandolin.\n",

            "\n",
            "Hence the increasingly great lengths actors go to in order to nail an accent down. Scot Martin Compston stays in his London accent throughout the four months it takes to film a series of BBC cop drama Line of Duty. Booksmart actress Beanie Feldstein worked in a Wolverhampton shop to hone the Black Country accent necessary for her lead role in the upcoming film adaptation of Caitlin Moran’s best-selling novel How to Build a Girl. Meanwhile, for the forthcoming Ohio-set film Queen & Slim, London-born Daniel Kaluuya worked at a Costco in Cleveland. As Humphries puts it: “The thing about theatre is that that performance is then gone. But on screen, that performance is around forever, and it’s within your interests not to f**k it up. People won’t forget it.”\n",
            "\n",
            "However, with all the scrutiny applied to getting accents right these days, another option that has crept in very recently is to forgo the challenge by ignoring ‘authenticity’ completely, and have actors simply perform in their native intonation. Such was the case with last year’s critically-acclaimed HBO series Chernobyl, which told the story of the 1985 Soviet nuclear disaster with a largely British cast speaking in various different varieties of British accent. “What we found very quickly is that actors will act accents,” said creator and script-writer Craig Mazin explaining the decision. “They will not act, they will act accents, and we were losing everything about these people that we loved... My hope is that the accent thing just fades away in seconds, and you stop caring about it.”\n",
            "\n",
            "What is ‘authentic’?\n",
            "\n",
            "Such a creative strategy may seem to offer a ‘backlash’ against authenticity, but perhaps it’s more about the creators concentrating on being authentic to the essence of the story, rather than every tiny detail. Another example of this approach can be found in Armando Iannucci’s The Death of Stalin, where Soviet officials have accents from Brooklyn, Yorkshire and the East End. Humphries says that this option of abandoning accuracy is also becoming more common in theatre: “For a really long time, things needed to be quite rigid and firmly in place, and now there’s this real fluidity... If [the performance] is really good then the only people who are moaning about [accuracy] tend to be old-school purists and they’re just quite boring.”\n",

            "You’ve got to pump yourself full of all this knowledge about how to stand, how to speak, so that once you’re on set, with any luck, it’ll be in your body and your voice – Rebecca Humphries\n",
            "\n",
            "However if you are going to put a different voice on, in order to avoid Mazin’s concern of “acting accents”, Humphries says that the key is to get to a point of feeling physically at ease. “The idea being that you’ve got to pump yourself full of all this knowledge about how to stand, how to speak, so that once you’re on set, with any luck, it’ll be in your body and your voice so that you can do the acting and the reacting – the good stuff.”\n",
            "\n",
            "But that process is a luxury rarely afforded to many shows, when time is short and performers have tight schedules as they move between jobs. Actor Charlie Allen explains that in theatre, there is often more of an opportunity to perfect an accent. “If you’re doing film and TV, you’re essentially kind of on your own before you turn up on set, and you’re not necessarily getting the feedback or guidance that you would do if you were in the theatre rehearsal room.”\n",
            "\n",
            "Brighton-born Allen has direct experience of this, facing the same challenge as the Peaky Blinders cast recently when playing a Brummie character in new play, Skin in the Game by Paul Westwood. Even more dauntingly, one performance actually took place in a community centre at the foot of the Birmingham high-rise block of flats in which the play is set. In contrast to Peaky Blinders, though, the accents went down well: “I think I cheated a little bit because I actually have family from Birmingham,” Allen says. “Saying that, it’s one thing speaking to your family and speaking in your own natural rhythm [and another] when you’re picking up somebody’s play script and all of a sudden you have very specific things to say. And it was quite easy to tip over into Liverpudlian or Scouse, which we hadn’t even considered at all.”\n",
            "\n",
            "To fudge or not to fudge?\n",
            "\n",
            "However, although people might profess to crave authenticity, meticulous accuracy isn’t always helpful – or at least considered financially judicious. Often an accent can be historically accurate, while also being seen as alienating to a mass audience by the moneymen. For example, Chris Pine was mostly praised for his Scottish accent as Robert the Bruce in Netflix’s Outlaw King, but in real life, the 14th-Century Scotsman would probably have been speaking French. It isn’t surprising that producers decided to forgo the confusion that would inevitably have arisen from making him a Francophone.\n",
            "\n",
            "Sometimes, either the producers or the actors themselves decide that a fudged accent, resting loosely in the vicinity of the correct pronunciation, might be the sweetest, and certainly the safest, spot for the widest possible audience to understand. The US Deep South is particularly at risk: Reese Witherspoon in Sweet Home Alabama, Julia Roberts in Charlie Wilson’s War and those of The Walking Dead cast who aren’t originally from Georgia have all been called out for being generically Southern, rather than specific to the states in which they’re set.\n",
            "\n",
            "However Windley disagrees with such fudging. “If you’re going to set it in a particular place, you really are duty bound, I think, to find the authenticity of that place,” he says. “But that doesn’t mean to say you can only cast actors who come from there.” He prefers to talk about “speech systems” rather than accents or dialects, which he finds “problematic” terminology that fails to take in the diversity of human speech, or to acknowledge how voices are informed by age, gender, time and cultural context. The way we speak, he says, is “a living force. It’s not an external piece of clothing that you stick on from the outside”.\n",
            "\n",
            "Accents are not just about the voice. The accent can make you hold your head differently – Ania Marson\n",
            "\n",
            "He continues: “If you just study a speech system without fully exploring the context, and then you put it over the top of a situation, it will come over as phoney.” In short, getting an accent right is a lot more complicated, say, than simply shortening a few vowel sounds and calling everyone ‘duckie’. An accent needs to be embedded into the context of the story, rather than floating around on top of the performance, connected to nothing.\n",
            "\n",
            "Actress Ania Marson agrees. She has been acting for almost six decades, most recently appearing in Killing Eve, The Alienist and Britannia. “Accents are not just about the voice,” she says. “The accent can make you hold your head differently. Your whole mouth changes in order to incorporate that, so there’s a kind of physicality that takes over which is fascinating. If you’re doing it in the right way, you sort of morph into a different person.”\n",
            "\n",
            "There are some accents in film and TV history that are almost unanimously accepted as terrible, whether because they wander like the critically panned Keanu Reeves in Bram Stoker’s Dracula, whose attempt at a posh London accent does abominable things to vowels – or because the choice doesn’t ring true, like Angelina Jolie opting for a Russian-ish inflection despite Alexander’s Ancient Greek setting. Others are polarising: whether or not Robert Pattinson’s Monty-Python-esque take on the Dauphin in Netflix’s The King works probably depends on whether you thought his camply exaggerated French accent was hilarious or hideous.\n",
            "\n",
            "But how we judge accents often comes down to a subjective decision about how important we think authenticity is in any particular instance. What is crucial is that we believe the stories we are watching, and that belief comes from somewhere considerably more inscrutable than what country, region or state a character sounds like they’re from.\n",
            "\n",
            "However, considering all the potential risks that come with attempting an accent, it does seem worth asking the question, is it absolutely necessary to try putting one on in the first place? Dr Dolittle is not, of course, a real person, and authenticity is probably not the most important element in a story about talking animals. Having said that, given that Robert Downey Jr’s voice still seems to the least believable part of it, producers might be wishing that he’d stuck with his native New York tongue – or at least plumped for London, given his previous experience playing Sherlock Holmes.\n",
            "\n",

            "\n",
            "And in a country where costly infrastructure projects such as HS2 and Crossrail take an eternity to build, Flybe has provided a nimble solution to tough transport problems. For example, some 68% of Belfast airport flights, and 90% of Southampton's, are operated by Flybe.\n",

            "When I was a child I dreamed of becoming a vet. I imagined myself playing with mischievous puppies, calming down frightened kittens, and - as I was a countryside kid - performing check-ups on the local farm animals if they felt under the weather.\n",
            "\n",
            "It was a pretty idyllic life that I dreamt up for myself - but it's not quite how things worked out. Instead, I ended up working in a slaughterhouse.\n",

            "I was there for six years and, far from spending my days making poorly cows feel better, I was in charge of ensuring about 250 of them were killed every day.\n",
            "\n",
            "Whether they eat meat or not, most people in the UK have never been inside an abattoir - and for good reason. They are filthy, dirty places. There's animal faeces on the floor, you see and smell the guts, and the walls are covered in blood.\n",
            "\n",
            "And the smell... It hits you like a wall when you first enter, and then hangs thick in the air around you. The odour of dying animals surrounds you like a vapour.\n",

            "Why would anybody choose to visit, let alone work in a place like this?\n",
            "\n",
            "For me, it was because I'd already spent a couple of decades working in the food industry - in ready-meal factories and the like. So when I got an offer from an abattoir to be a quality control manager, working directly with the slaughtermen, it felt like a fairly innocuous job move. I was in my 40s at the time.\n",
            "\n",
            "On my first day, they gave me a tour of the premises, explained how everything worked and, most importantly, asked me pointedly and repeatedly if I was OK. It was quite common for people to faint during the tour, they explained, and the physical safety of visitors and new starters was very important to them. I was OK, I think. I felt sick, but I thought I'd get used to it.\n",
            "\n",
            "Soon, though, I realised there was no point pretending that it was just another job. I'm sure not all abattoirs are the same but mine was a brutal, dangerous place to work. There were countless occasions when, despite following all of the procedures for stunning, slaughterers would get kicked by a massive, spasming cow as they hoisted it up to the machine for slaughter. Similarly, cows being brought in would get scared and panic, which was pretty terrifying for all of us too. You'll know if you've ever stood next to one that they are huge animals.\n",

            "\n",
            "As I spent day after day in that large, windowless box, my chest felt increasingly heavy and a grey fog descended over me. At night, my mind would taunt me with nightmares, replaying some of the horrors I'd witnessed throughout the day.\n",
            "\n",
            "One skill that you master while working at an abattoir is disassociation. You learn to become numb to death and to suffering. Instead of thinking about cows as entire beings, you separate them into their saleable, edible body parts. It doesn't just make the job easier - it's necessary for survival.\n",
            "\n",
            "There are things, though, that have the power to shatter the numbness. For me, it was the heads.\n",
            "\n",
            "At the end of the slaughter line there was a huge skip, and it was filled with hundreds of cows' heads. Each one of them had been flayed, with all of the saleable flesh removed. But one thing was still attached - their eyeballs.\n",
            "\n",
            "Whenever I walked past that skip, I couldn't help but feel like I had hundreds of pairs of eyes watching me. Some of them were accusing, knowing that I'd participated in their deaths. Others seemed to be pleading, as if there were some way I could go back in time and save them. It was disgusting, terrifying and heart-breaking, all at the same time. It made me feel guilty. The first time I saw those heads, it took all of my strength not to vomit.\n",
            "\n",
            "I know things like this bothered the other workers, too. I'll never forget the day, after I'd been at the abattoir for a few months, when one of the lads cut into a freshly killed cow to gut her - and out fell the foetus of a calf. She was pregnant. He immediately started shouting and throwing his arms about.\n",
            "\n",
            "I took him into a meeting room to calm him down - and all he could say was, \"It's just not right, it's not right,\" over and over again. These were hard men, and they rarely showed any emotion. But I could see tears prickling his eyes.\n",

            "At the height of the BSE and bovine tuberculosis crises in the 1990s, whole herds of animals had to be slaughtered. I worked at the slaughterhouse after 2010, so well after the BSE crisis, but if an animal tested positive for TB or BSE they would still bring the entire herd in to be culled - bulls, heifers and calves. I remember one day in particular, when I'd been there for about a year or so, when we had to slaughter five calves at the same time.\n",
            "\n",
            "We tried to keep them within the rails of the pens, but they were so small and bony that they could easily skip out and trot around, slightly wobbly on their newly born legs. They sniffed us, like puppies, because they were young and curious. Some of the boys and I stroked them, and they suckled our fingers.\n",
            "\n",
            "When the time came to kill them, it was tough, both emotionally and physically. Slaughterhouses are designed for slaughtering really large animals, so the stun boxes are normally just about the right size to hold a cow that weighs about a tonne.

            "   Just outside the remote Russian village of Dargavs lies a medieval necropolis fittingly called the “City of the Dead”. This ancient burial ground holds the remains of more than 10,000 people – many of whom lie eternally with their clothes and belongings – and some locals believe that anyone who dares to enter won’t return alive. While much mystery surrounds this graveyard located just over the border from Georgia (even the date of its construction is still just an estimate) historians are gradually unravelling its full story.\n",
            "\n",
            "Since the 16th Century, this remote stretch of southern Russian farmland has been used as a burial ground; its origins, though, are still unclear. One theory is that when territory was scarce during the 13th-Century Mongol-Tatar invasion, locals living in this 17km valley of the Caucasus mountains began to create similarly structured above-ground crypts to conserve space. Another theory suggests that the City of the Dead was created following the Indo-Iranian tradition established by the migrating Sarmatians who settled in southern Russia and buried their dead above ground to respect the land.\n",
            "\n",
            "Today, the site comprises 99 remarkably conserved medieval curved-roof crypts with single windows, and contains more than 100 bodies. Some are so well preserved that flesh is still attached to their bones.\n",
            "\n",
            "This media cannot be played on your device.\n",
            "\n",
            "The City of the Dead’s story also incorporates another piece of the region’s history: a series of plague epidemics in the 17th and 18th Centuries. There is evidence that infected residents quarantined themselves in the crypts as they waited for death to approach. Some bodies inside the crypts are also buried inside wooden coffins that resemble boats, and one corpse was even discovered with an oar next to it. With no navigable rivers nearby, some historians think ancient residents believed that one must cross a river to reach heaven.\n",
            "\n",
            "While many visitors travel to this 1.5-hectare cemetery to see remarkably well-preserved medieval architecture, historian Luidmila Gaboeva believes they come away with something more. “The people who come here in awe of the beauty of this place achieve peace with the eternal fear of death,” she said.\n",

              "  'text': '\\n   At the ripe old age of 100, Dr Dolittle has been reincarnated in the form of Robert Downey Jr. In the latest screen version of the children’s literature classic, Dolittle, released in the US today, he is also Welsh… or at least Wales-adjacent. Because whilst he’s still able to talk to the animals, it would appear that Dr Dolittle is not so proficient in his new native voice.\\n\\nMore like this:\\n\\n- The brilliant women the Oscars ignored\\n\\n- What makes a Hollywood heartthrob?\\n\\n- Will the Star Wars universe survive?\\n\\nThere was tantalisingly (and tellingly) little of Downey Jr speaking in the film’s trailer but just enough to threaten a film already beset by production issues – a title change, reshoots, and a postponed release date – with the heavy burden of an infamously bad accent. And now reviews have confirmed that his pronunciation is wayward, to say the least, with Vulture’s Bilge Ebiri describing it as “an ill-advised and half-hearted Welsh accent which occasionally (and I’m assuming inadvertently) slips into Irish, Indian and Jamaican intonations”.\\n\\nThe Dodgy Accent Hall of Fame (ruled over, of course, by Dick van Dyke) is a busy place. Echoing through its chambers are Russell Crowe’s not-very-Nottinghamshire Robin Hood, Anne Hathaway’s clunky ‘Yorkshire’ twang in One Day, Don Cheadle’s all-gone-Pete-Tong Cockney in the Ocean’s Eleven franchise, and rather too many non-native Bostonians from The Departed cast.\\n\\nRecently, almost the entire cast of BBC gangster drama Peaky Blinders has been inducted. No other production seems to have generated quite the onslaught of accent-based anger as the Shelby family and their compatriots bringing cod-Brummie to the masses. Even the Scottish and Northern Irish characters have been called out for missing the mark.\\n\\nOur new accent fixation\\n\\nIt seems like we’re more obsessed with analysing accents than ever before. Voice coach Erik Singer garners millions of views for his videos critiquing accents from Idris Elba to Daniel Day-Lewis to Cate Blanchett, while on the flip-side, there are some actors who assimilate so seamlessly, that the uproar comes when audiences hear them speak out of character. Killing Eve fans were shocked to hear Jodie Comer’s Liverpudlian accent in real-life after getting to know her as that show’s vocally chameleonic assassin Villanelle, who switches between Russian, French, Italian and German. And Christian Bale has played so many iconic roles using US accents – Patrick Bateman, Batman and Dick Cheney, to name a few – that audiences are often surprised to hear his own voice (he was born in Wales but grew up in England) when he gives interviews and awards speeches.\\n\\nAlso, when done right, putting on an accent definitely offers a little bump to your award-season chances, as demonstrated this year by the likes of Florence Pugh and Saoirse Ronan convincingly relocating their respective British and Irish accents to 19th-Century Massachusetts for Little Women, or native Aussie Margot Robbie turning American in Bombshell and Once Upon a Time… in Hollywood.\\n\\nThe key things to mastering an accent are courage, playfulness, a good ear, inventiveness, creativity and a real sensitivity – Joe Windley\\n\\nFor Rada lead voice tutor Joe Windley, the keys to mastering an accent successfully are “courage, playfulness, a good ear, inventiveness, creativity and a real sensitivity to the diverse range of sounds that can be used in any given speech system” (and for what it’s worth, Jodie Comer is top of his list of most vocally-skilled stars). Meanwhile the real challenge for actors is being “able to manifest the speech in such a way that it serves clarity and maintains authenticity”.\\n\\nClassical acting training has traditionally focused on the voice being ‘whole’, meaning full of tone and fully articulate, but this is not how most people naturally speak. Recently, instead, there has been a contrasting obsession with authenticity, even though the specificity of an accent might only be noticeable to the community from which it comes. For example if the accents in Peaky Blinders sounded lightweight to locals, in the US they have proved convincingly alien enough that viewers have been switching on the subtitles. And trying to determine an ‘authentic’ accent for any particular country or region is not clear-cut: even when we speak in our own accent, it can vary significantly, as we code-switch depending on what context or to whom we are speaking.\\n\\nA truly bad accent has always had the capacity to derail a production, yanking audiences out of the moment as it becomes impossible to look – or should that be listen – past. But, more than that, dodgy accents can also be morally problematic, serving to reinforce stereotypes, as explored in Hari Kondabolu’s 2017 documentary The Problem With Apu.\\n\\nThe days when English-speaking actors put on accents and told the world they were Russian or German or Swedish or Italian – those days are gone – Ralph Fiennes\\n\\nThe film looks at the Simpsons character of Apu Nahasapeemapetilon: one of the best-known (and only) representations of a south Asian person on mainstream television, but voiced by white actor Hank Azaria with a deliberately comic exaggeration that has increasingly been called out as racist. The problem of south Asian vocal caricaturing is also highlighted in Aziz Ansari’s Netflix comedy Master of None which features an episode titled Indians on TV, and deals with south Asian actors being asked to do stereotypical ‘Indian’ accents at auditions.\\n\\nNo more ‘funny voices’\\n\\nAccents are absolutely part of the wider debate about representation in film and TV. The idea of an accent, particularly one of a different nationality to the actor, being just a ‘funny voice’ is increasingly unacceptable. When Ralph Fiennes was promoting The White Crow, his biopic of Rudolf Nureyev, he told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme of his decision to cast predominantly Russian actors: “I feel the days when English-speaking actors put on accents and told the world they were Russian or German or Swedish or Italian – those days are gone. One has read quite a lot of critical responses to films that are still doing that, where people go, ‘Haven’t we had enough?’ The landscape has shifted.”\\n\\nAdditionally, the deployment of accents can still be reflective of classism, and domination by the middle-and-upper classes. As actress Rebecca Humphries points out, for example, regional British accents are still sometimes used as a punchline. Humphries, who has worked at the Donmar Warehouse, National Theatre Company and the Royal Shakespeare Company, is originally from Norfolk, and is currently filming a project playing an extremely posh character, with a dialect coach on set. As a working-class person, she is conscious not to mock the accent, but says that in Shakespeare, it can be the opposite, when a broad, regional, working-class accent is frequently used for comedic roles. “It does my utter head in,” she says. “To make it ‘funny’. It’s because there’s a class snobbery there that the thicker [accent you have], the funnier you are.”\\n\\nThese days, actors have more reason to worry about getting their character’s chosen pronunciation right, however – for in 2020, film and television are not just available for consumption but for dissection. Screen-grabs and sound clips allow us to pore over performances for embarrassing mistakes, whether Quentin Tarantino’s misguided effort at Australian in Django Unchained (highlighting the perils of directing yourself) or Nicholas Cage’s Dolmio-esque Italian in Captain Corelli’s Mandolin.\\n\\nWhat we found very quickly is that actors will act accents. They will not act, they will act accents – Craig Mazin\\n\\nHence the increasingly great lengths actors go to in order to nail an accent down. Scot Martin Compston stays in his London accent throughout the four months it takes to film a series of BBC cop drama Line of Duty. Booksmart actress Beanie Feldstein worked in a Wolverhampton shop to hone the Black Country accent necessary for her lead role in the upcoming film adaptation of Caitlin Moran’s best-selling novel How to Build a Girl. Meanwhile, for the forthcoming Ohio-set film Queen & Slim, London-born Daniel Kaluuya worked at a Costco in Cleveland. As Humphries puts it: “The thing about theatre is that that performance is then gone. But on screen, that performance is around forever, and it’s within your interests not to f**k it up. People won’t forget it.”\\n\\nHowever, with all the scrutiny applied to getting accents right these days, another option that has crept in very recently is to forgo the challenge by ignoring ‘authenticity’ completely, and have actors simply perform in their native intonation. Such was the case with last year’s critically-acclaimed HBO series Chernobyl, which told the story of the 1985 Soviet nuclear disaster with a largely British cast speaking in various different varieties of British accent. “What we found very quickly is that actors will act accents,” said creator and script-writer Craig Mazin explaining the decision. “They will not act, they will act accents, and we were losing everything about these people that we loved... My hope is that the accent thing just fades away in seconds, and you stop caring about it.”\\n\\nWhat is ‘authentic’?\\n\\nSuch a creative strategy may seem to offer a ‘backlash’ against authenticity, but perhaps it’s more about the creators concentrating on being authentic to the essence of the story, rather than every tiny detail. Another example of this approach can be found in Armando Iannucci’s The Death of Stalin, where Soviet officials have accents from Brooklyn, Yorkshire and the East End. Humphries says that this option of abandoning accuracy is also becoming more common in theatre: “For a really long time, things needed to be quite rigid and firmly in place, and now there’s this real fluidity... If [the performance] is really good then the only people who are moaning about [accuracy] tend to be old-school purists and they’re just quite boring.”\\n\\nYou’ve got to pump yourself full of all this knowledge about how to stand, how to speak, so that once you’re on set, with any luck, it’ll be in your body and your voice – Rebecca Humphries\\n\\nHowever if you are going to put a different voice on, in order to avoid Mazin’s concern of “acting accents”, Humphries says that the key is to get to a point of feeling physically at ease. “The idea being that you’ve got to pump yourself full of all this knowledge about how to stand, how to speak, so that once you’re on set, with any luck, it’ll be in your body and your voice so that you can do the acting and the reacting – the good stuff.”\\n\\nBut that process is a luxury rarely afforded to many shows, when time is short and performers have tight schedules as they move between jobs. Actor Charlie Allen explains that in theatre, there is often more of an opportunity to perfect an accent. “If you’re doing film and TV, you’re essentially kind of on your own before you turn up on set, and you’re not necessarily getting the feedback or guidance that you would do if you were in the theatre rehearsal room.”\\n\\nBrighton-born Allen has direct experience of this, facing the same challenge as the Peaky Blinders cast recently when playing a Brummie character in new play, Skin in the Game by Paul Westwood. Even more dauntingly, one performance actually took place in a community centre at the foot of the Birmingham high-rise block of flats in which the play is set. In contrast to Peaky Blinders, though, the accents went down well: “I think I cheated a little bit because I actually have family from Birmingham,” Allen says. “Saying that, it’s one thing speaking to your family and speaking in your own natural rhythm [and another] when you’re picking up somebody’s play script and all of a sudden you have very specific things to say. And it was quite easy to tip over into Liverpudlian or Scouse, which we hadn’t even considered at all.”\\n\\nTo fudge or not to fudge?\\n\\nHowever, although people might profess to crave authenticity, meticulous accuracy isn’t always helpful – or at least considered financially judicious. Often an accent can be historically accurate, while also being seen as alienating to a mass audience by the moneymen. For example, Chris Pine was mostly praised for his Scottish accent as Robert the Bruce in Netflix’s Outlaw King, but in real life, the 14th-Century Scotsman would probably have been speaking French. It isn’t surprising that producers decided to forgo the confusion that would inevitably have arisen from making him a Francophone.\\n\\nSometimes, either the producers or the actors themselves decide that a fudged accent, resting loosely in the vicinity of the correct pronunciation, might be the sweetest, and certainly the safest, spot for the widest possible audience to understand. The US Deep South is particularly at risk: Reese Witherspoon in Sweet Home Alabama, Julia Roberts in Charlie Wilson’s War and those of The Walking Dead cast who aren’t originally from Georgia have all been called out for being generically Southern, rather than specific to the states in which they’re set.\\n\\nHowever Windley disagrees with such fudging. “If you’re going to set it in a particular place, you really are duty bound, I think, to find the authenticity of that place,” he says. “But that doesn’t mean to say you can only cast actors who come from there.” He prefers to talk about “speech systems” rather than accents or dialects, which he finds “problematic” terminology that fails to take in the diversity of human speech, or to acknowledge how voices are informed by age, gender, time and cultural context. The way we speak, he says, is “a living force. It’s not an external piece of clothing that you stick on from the outside”.\\n\\nAccents are not just about the voice. The accent can make you hold your head differently – Ania Marson\\n\\nHe continues: “If you just study a speech system without fully exploring the context, and then you put it over the top of a situation, it will come over as phoney.” In short, getting an accent right is a lot more complicated, say, than simply shortening a few vowel sounds and calling everyone ‘duckie’. An accent needs to be embedded into the context of the story, rather than floating around on top of the performance, connected to nothing.\\n\\nActress Ania Marson agrees. She has been acting for almost six decades, most recently appearing in Killing Eve, The Alienist and Britannia. “Accents are not just about the voice,” she says. “The accent can make you hold your head differently. Your whole mouth changes in order to incorporate that, so there’s a kind of physicality that takes over which is fascinating. If you’re doing it in the right way, you sort of morph into a different person.”\\n\\nThere are some accents in film and TV history that are almost unanimously accepted as terrible, whether because they wander like the critically panned Keanu Reeves in Bram Stoker’s Dracula, whose attempt at a posh London accent does abominable things to vowels – or because the choice doesn’t ring true, like Angelina Jolie opting for a Russian-ish inflection despite Alexander’s Ancient Greek setting. Others are polarising: whether or not Robert Pattinson’s Monty-Python-esque take on the Dauphin in Netflix’s The King works probably depends on whether you thought his camply exaggerated French accent was hilarious or hideous.\\n\\nBut how we judge accents often comes down to a subjective decision about how important we think authenticity is in any particular instance. What is crucial is that we believe the stories we are watching, and that belief comes from somewhere considerably more inscrutable than what country, region or state a character sounds like they’re from.\\n\\nHowever, considering all the potential risks that come with attempting an accent, it does seem worth asking the question, is it absolutely necessary to try putting one on in the first place? Dr Dolittle is not, of course, a real person, and authenticity is probably not the most important element in a story about talking animals. Having said that, given that Robert Downey Jr’s voice still seems to the least believable part of it, producers might be wishing that he’d stuck with his native New York tongue – or at least plumped for London, given his previous experience playing Sherlock Holmes.\\n\\nDolittle is released today in the US and 7 February in the UK and Ireland.\\n\\nLove film?

The craggy rocks are known as Mistaken Point, an homage to the many ships that met their untimely end there after sailors ‘mistook’ them for a different place. Now the wild and jagged cliffs are famous for another reason. They are at the centre of a debate about one of Earth’s greatest mysteries – just how and when did complex life first evolve?\\n\\n“If you walk around the rocks you will find surfaces covered in literally thousands of fossils,” says Frankie Dunn, a paleobiologist at Oxford University.\\n\\nThe fossils were preserved about 570 million years ago during the Ediacaran period, when a series of volcanic eruptions covered the seafloor in ash, providing a ‘snapshot’ of life at the time.\\n\\n“The way I would describe it is like walking around Pompeii, you can see the ghosts of the creatures that lived there buried under volcanic ash; it’s really an incredible experience,” says Dunn.\\n\\nYou might also like:\\n\\nThe Ediacaran fossils herald a watershed moment in the history of Earth – for the previous four billion years, the oceans had been the preserve of single-celled microbes, yet suddenly they were teeming with new complex life. And what strange life it was. The creatures look nothing like anything seen today.\\n\\nSome, like the rangeomorphs resembled giant leafy ferns. Others had a bush, or cabbage-like appearance. Many looked like shapeless sacs, or thin, quilted pillows, while others bore a resemblance to enormous sea pens.\\n\\n“Most Ediacarans are soft bodied and a bit squidgy,” says Simon Darroch, a paleontologist at Vanderbilt University in Tennessee. “The ability to form shells or skeletons didn’t evolve until the end of the Ediacaran period.”\\n  '},\n",

              "  'text': '\\n   Image copyright Paul Sudmals / Reuters\\n\\nThere is a widely-reported estimate that almost half a billion (480 million) animals have been killed by the bush fires in Australia.\\n\\nIt\\'s a figure that came from Prof Chris Dickman, an expert on Australian biodiversity at the University of Sydney.\\n\\nHe released a statement explaining how he had reached the figure - a statement which refers to the number of animals affected rather than those necessarily dying as a direct result of the fire (although the title of the release talks about 480 million being killed).\\n\\nThe numbers are based on a report he co-wrote in 2007 for the World Wide Fund for Nature (WWF) on the impact of land-clearing on Australian wildlife in New South Wales.\\n\\nIt estimated that there were an average of 17.5 mammals, 20.7 birds and 129.5 reptiles per hectare (10,000 square metres, so a square 100m on each side - about the size of a rugby pitch).\\n\\nThey\\'ve then multiplied that by the amount of land hit by the fires.\\n\\n\"We\\'ve estimated that in the three million hectares of New South Wales alone that were burned up until about 10 days ago probably as many as 480 million mammals, birds and reptiles would have been affected by the fires,\" Prof Dickman said.\\n\\nImage copyright AFP\\n\\n\"Certainly, large animals, like kangaroos or emus - many birds, of course - will be able to move away from the fire as it approaches,\" he told BBC Breakfast.\\n\\n\"I guess it\\'s the less mobile species and the smaller ones that depend on the forest itself that are really in the firing line.\"\\n\\nBut he added that many of those that survived the actual fire would die later because of lack of food or shelter.\\n\\nColin Beale, an ecologist from University of York told Reality Check that may have been overstated.\\n\\nHe said: \"In the areas of Africa where I work I am quite sure that very few birds die as a direct result of fire. They certainly have the ability to fly away from fires, and this is surely the case in Australia, too.\"\\n\\nImage copyright EPA\\n\\nThere are a few caveats with these figures. First of all, the estimate is for damage only in New South Wales, and the fires have spread to Victoria.\\n\\nAlso, the three million hectares figure is somewhat out of date - the fires have spread since then. So it is likely that more animals have been affected than the estimate suggests.\\n\\nBut it is important to remember that this is just an estimate - its authors say the numbers are deliberately conservative. The figure for the number of reptiles is particularly uncertain, and reptiles make up three-quarters of the animals affected in these calculations.\\n\\n\"Density estimates are not available for many species, so they have had to be estimated from known densities of other species,\" Tom Oliver, professor of applied ecology at University of Reading, told Reality Check.\\n\\n\"For reptiles, there are no density estimates of individual species at all, just an estimate from a single study (Ehmann and Cogger 1985), which estimates 10 individuals per species per hectare.\"\\n\\nColin Beale added: \"Although it is hard to find estimates of how well reptiles survive fires, in similar areas of Australia the majority of these reptiles live in the soil.\"\\n\\n\"Soil is a very good thermal insulator and burrowing reptiles can certainly show very low mortality even during intense fires.\"\\n\\n\"It seems extremely unlikely that the majority of the animals affected by fire are actually killed, though we may still ask whether they will survive longer-term.\"\\n\\nWhat claims do you want BBC Reality Check to investigate?

And how far I can expect to go.\"\\n\\n\"The main difference is that I don\\'t have a full fuel tank. I need to think a lot about how I\\'m using my power.\"\\n\\nAs we talk an alarm starts beeping. \"Oh this tells me I do not have power for a new return trip without recharging,\" Captain Larsen says calmly.\\n\\nPowered entirely by batteries, Ellen is something of a Tesla among ferries. Fully charged, the 60m vessel can sail 22 nautical miles with up to 200 passengers and 30 cars onboard.\\n\\nImage copyright Adrienne Murray Image caption Ellen has a range of 22 nautical miles\\n\\nThat\\'s a roughly 40km (25-mile) round-trip, and seven times further than other electric ferries.\\n\\nEllen replaces an older diesel-powered vessel, and in the onboard cafe passengers welcome the change.\\n\\n\"It doesn\\'t make so much noise. And no smoke from the diesel - it\\'s good,\" one traveller tells me.\\n\\n\"It\\'s very quiet. You don\\'t feel anything. It\\'s a great idea also for the environment,\" says another.\\n\\n\"Ferry shipping in general is very dirty business,\" says Halfdan Abrahamsen, an information officer from Ærø EnergyLab, as he shows me around.\\n\\nMore Technology of Business\\n\\nShips usually use marine diesel or heavy fuel oil, \"which is just about the bottom of the food chain when it comes to product from refineries,\" says Mr Abrahamsen.\\n\\nThe only oil onboard Ellen is for the gearbox and in the kitchen for making French fries, he says.\\n\\nThe emission-free ferry is expected to reduce CO2 emissions by 2,000 tonnes a year. It\\'s part of an EU-backed project to develop green ferries for longer routes.\\n\\nBeyond a set of heavy metal doors, lies the engine and two battery rooms, where 840 lithium-ion batteries supplied by Swiss firm Leclanché, are stacked from floor to ceiling.\\n\\nImage copyright Adrienne Murray Image caption Two battery rooms house 840 lithium-ion batteries\\n\\nTotalling 4.3MWh, it has the biggest battery capacity of any ship at sea and equivalent to the average amount of electricity a UK household consumes each year.\\n\\nAnd that means it can sail further than any other electric ferry operating at the moment, according to Kimmo Rauma, vice-president of Danfoss Editron, the Finland-based company behind the electrical propulsion and charging technology.\\n\\nAfter a 70 minute voyage, Ellen arrives at the harbour in Søby and moors alongside the charging station.\\n\\nA mechanical arm plugs in and recharges the batteries in less than 25 minutes with clean energy supplied by local wind turbines.\\n\\nEllen is not fully operational just yet, and it hasn\\'t all been smooth sailing. Building a boat with so many batteries is complex and since being launched some battery cells have been replaced.\\n\\nImage copyright Adrienne Murray Image caption Trine Heinemann says Ellen\\'s running costs are a quarter that of a diesel ferry\\n\\n\"They\\'re getting lighter and more energy dense, but they\\'re still heavy,\" Trine Heinemann, the E-Ferry project coordinator explains, as we stand on the dockside.\\n\\n\"The more energy you need, the more batteries you need, the more weight you add. You then have to start thinking about how do we take other weight away from the ship? How do you build the most energy-efficient ship?\"\\n\\nA lower resistance design and more lightweight materials were used, contributing to Ellen\\'s low running costs.\\n\\n\"We are paying maybe 25% of what you would pay for running a similar diesel vessel.\" says Ms Heinemann. \"So that\\'s the significant saving.\"\\n\\nMaintenance costs are much lower too. A diesel engine has about 30,000 moving parts, in an electric motor it\\'s just the bearings that need maintenance, Dr Rauma says.\\n\\nImage copyright Adrienne Murray Image caption The green box on the right recharges Ellen\\'s batteries\\n\\nThe ferry has cost €21.3m (US$23.6m; £18.3m), with the EU\\'s Horizon 2020 programme funding €15m.\\n\\n\"It\\'s maybe 40% more expensive than a conventional diesel vessel,\" Ms Heinemann says.\\n\\n\"Then you still have the transformer and the electrical infrastructure. So in terms of establishing an electrical vessel, we are looking at a significantly higher cost.\"\\n\\nSo while battery power is certainly greener, is it commercially viable? The team believes so.\\n\\n\"Some say within 14 months you break even and then it\\'s saving from then on. We\\'re being a little bit more conservative and saying maybe four or five years,\" says Ms Heinemann.\\n\\nAt Søby Shipyard, where Ellen was built, chief executive Roar Falkenberg thinks costs will come down.\\n\\n\"Ellen was a prototype. I think when we build the next Ellen, it will be only cost a bit more than a normal ferry. And if you look three to five years ahead, I think the price will be the same.\"\\n\\nImage copyright Adrienne Murray Image caption Electric engines will require less maintenance\\n\\nBatteries are getting more cost-competitive says Dr Tristan Smith, a shipping and energy expert from University College London, thanks largely to better technology and stricter emissions rules.\\n\\n\"If you have strong air quality regulation then you aren\\'t able to burn the worst quality marine fuels,\" he says, \"which then makes the battery more competitive, because it\\'s now competing against the more expensive fossil fuel.\"\\n\\nThe shipping industry is responsible for around 3% of global CO2 and greenhouse gas emissions. In April 2018, the International Maritime Organisation set new targets to reduce these emissions by \"at least 50% by 2050 compared to 2008\" levels.\\n\\nThat\\'s spurring industry players to explore new emission-cutting measures including alternatives fuels like LNG, biofuel, also hydrogen and ammonia which Dr Smith thinks show most promise.\\n\\nImage copyright Norled Image caption Norled is part of a hydrogen-powered ferry project\\n\\nNordic countries have led a shift towards hybrid and electric power. The first fully-electric car ferry was launched in Norway a few years ago, and the operator Norled is now developing, what it claims will be the world\\'s first hydrogen-fuelled ferry.\\n\\n\"The technology is ready,\" says Danfoss Editron\\'s Kimmo Rauma. \"The question is that the maritime industry is not the fastest to change.\"\\n\\nHis firm has supplied electric technology for patrol-boats, icebreakers, and fish farming service boats.\\n\\nIt also developed Asia\\'s first e-ferry in Taiwan. He says retrofitting older diesel vessels with electric engines, particularly in city harbour areas, is a \"big opportunity\" to reduce pollution.\\n\\nHowever experts say that scaling up battery power for large ships has significant limitations.\\n\\n\"The common denominator for successful battery use is that the vessels operate close to shore,\" says Maria Skipper Schwenn, a director at industry body, Danish Shipping.\\n\\n\"The operational reach is limited simply due to the capacity of the battery itself. It\\'s simply not possible today when you are sailing more than 10 or 20 days at sea. In addition to that you need an enormous charging capacity in the port.\"\\n\\n\"With the technology we have right now… it doesn\\'t seem like a viable solution for the deep-sea shipping. But for ferries, supply ships and tugboats, it\\'s an excellent solution.\"\\n\\nBack at Søby Shipyard, Roar Falkenberg agrees. \"The key is how much energy can you store in the battery. If you have to sail from England to the United States, you need a lot! And then you can\\'t have any cargo, you can only have batteries. Maybe in 10 years, 15 years, there will be other ways for longer ship routes.\"\\n  '},\n",

The question is whether they can make competitive ones,\" questions Piero Scaruffi, a Silicon Valley historian, and artificial intelligence researcher who works in Silicon Valley.\\n\\nMore Technology of Business\\n\\n\"Certainly, Huawei can develop its own chips and operating systems, and the government can make sure that they will be successful in China. But Huawei and other Chinese phone makers are successful also in foreign markets, and that\\'s a totally different question: Will Huawei\\'s chips and operating systems be as competitive as Qualcomm\\'s and Android? Most likely not. At best, it will take years before they are,\" Mr Scaruffi adds.\\n\\nMr Scaruffi estimates that China could be as many as 10 years behind the leading producers of high-end computer chips. The majority of chips made for high-end electronics are manufactured by specialist foundries like the Taiwanese Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC). It produces more than 70% of chips designed by third party companies.\\n\\nJust securing the best machinery needed to make high-end chips is difficult.\\n\\n\"To start out with equipment, its very high precision equipment. You need to print very fine features. The equipment that is needed to have this kind of technology is controlled by a few companies in the world,\" says Mr Yue.\\n\\nHe believes that Chinese technology is three to four generations behind companies like TSMC.

In the late 2000s the introduction of smartphones boosted demand for the tiny integrated circuits that control everything from memory to Bluetooth and wifi.\\n\\nBut today China\\'s ambition to dominate sectors such as artificial intelligence and 5G is expected to further ramp up demand for high-end chips.\\n\\nIndustry analysts like Mr Scaruffi question China\\'s ability to truly innovate. \"Every Chinese city wants to build its own Silicon Valley. It tends to be more driven from the top. Silicon Valley had a big advantage, that it was very far away from the political power,\" says Mr Scaruffi.\\n\\nHe believes that China\\'s technological success lies in the implementation of technology rather than its creation.\\n\\n\"If your metric is how many people use smart phones to go shopping then China wins big time.

This is a trade practice known as \"dumping\".\\n\\nThe US government investigated, and back in 1994 agreed that some Chinese firms were indeed selling their garlic in the US \"at less than fair value\".\\n\\nAs a result, any Chinese company found guilty of the practice was hit by a whopping 377% duty. However, Chinese firms soon found ways around these case-by-case penalties, such as by simply setting up new shell businesses.\\n\\nMr Christopher likened it to \"playing whack-a-mole\", and cheap Chinese garlic continued to flood into the US. As a result of this, of the 12 US commercial garlic farms that existed in the 1990s, only three of the largest producers survived.\\n\\nToday the remaining US garlic farmers say that Trump\\'s tariffs on Chinese garlic are working because they apply across the board and straight away - there is now no way for the importers to get around them.\\n\\nUS tariffs on Chinese garlic were first set at 10% in September 2018, before rising to 25% from May of this year.\\n\\nImage caption The US garlic industry is centred on the Californian city of Gilroy\\n\\n\"Trump\\'s tariffs are all assessed and billed up front,\" says Mr Christopher. \"So it is impossible for dumpers from China to evade them.\"\\n\\nChristopher Ranch was one of the three US garlic producers that made it through the 1990s. Today it harvests more than 100 million pounds (45 million kg) of the bulbs every year, supplying almost one third of all fresh garlic consumed in the US.\\n\\nMr Christopher says that the family-owned business has seen sales soar since the tariffs on Chinese imports were first put in place.\\n\\n\"We\\'re seeing growth year-over-year of between 6 to 23% every week on our fresh garlic,\" he says. \"It may not seem like a lot, but when measured in millions of pounds [in weight of sales] it makes a huge difference to our bottom line.\"\\n\\nTo access the impact of the tariffs, the BBC looked at daily prices measured by the US Department of Agriculture.\\n\\nFor white garlic sold in Boston in August, 2018, a 30lb (13.6kg) box from China cost between $25 and $30 (£19 and £23). A container of Californian garlic of the same size was $68.\\n\\nFollowing the tariffs, the cost of the same box of Chinese garlic has risen to between $52 and $55, while the Californian garlic is now between $70 and $74. So while the Chinese garlic is still cheaper, the difference in price has markedly narrowed.\\n\\nImage copyright Vessey & Co Image caption Californian farming business Vessey & Co closed its garlic division after growing it alongside cabbage and cauliflower for 100 years\\n\\nFourth generation Californian farmer Jack Vessey is, however, missing out on the renewed demand for US garlic - his family business Vessey & Company stopped growing the crop a number of years ago, as they couldn\\'t make it profitable in the face of the Chinese imports.\\n\\n\"Stepping away from the garlic business was a very difficult decision for me,\" he says.\\n\\n\"There were three generations before me who dedicated much of their lives to garlic. [But] I decided that if there was a chance for our business to survive into a fifth generation we had to divest our garlic holdings.\"\\n\\nFor almost 100 years his family had grown garlic together with other vegetables, such as cabbage and cauliflower.\\n\\nRivals is a season of in-depth coverage on BBC News about the contest for supremacy between the US and China across trade, tech, defence and soft power.\\n\\nRead more here.\\n\\n\"Garlic, for many years, accounted for more than 50% of our receipts,\" adds Mr Vessey. \"But once the Chinese began dumping product in the US market, we started to cut back on our acreage and build other sectors of our business.\"\\n\\nFrank Lavin, a former Under Secretary for International Trade at the Department of Commerce, explains that the problem with the levy introduced in 1994 was that the Chinese importers were too fast on their feet.\\n\\n\"They would be discovered and sanctioned, and then they would simply set up another dummy structure,\" he says.\\n\\n\"The fact is they were more nimble, occasionally, in setting up these entities than US Customs could be in discovering them.\"\\n\\nImage caption Higher garlic prices are now being passed onto consumers, but Mr Christopher says the US industry needed help\\n\\nMr Christopher says that - by contrast - President Trump\\'s tariffs \"are very easy to enforce because garlic can\\'t even enter the country now before the tariff is billed to them. That\\'s what\\'s tactically changing the game.\"\\n\\nHe adds that the media is wrong to attack the president\\'s strident tariff policy - the US has now put in place tariffs on $200bn of Chinese goods.\\n\\n\"It\\'s been a difficult thing to talk about, as the media continually simplifies the tariffs as injuring farmers, whereas it actually benefits the domestic garlic industry,\" says Mr Christopher.\\n\\nGlobal Trade\\n\\nMore from the BBC\\'s series taking an international perspective on trade:\\n\\nHowever, trade experts caution that higher costs are likely to be passed onto consumers.\\n\\n\"If you are a domestic firm that is being sheltered from foreign competition by tariff walls, then you tend to like tariffs because it keeps out foreign competition,\" says Deborah Elms, head of the Temasek Foundation Centre for Trade and Negotiations.\\n\\n\"But what that does is keep out foreign competition and allow domestic competitors to potentially provide goods that are less competitive in the longer run.\"\\n\\nMr Christopher says that while he understands that it is \"not in the long-term macroeconomic interest of the US to engage in trade wars, our industry needed immediate relief\".\\n  '},\n",

In one tweet he wrote about losing $500bn (£388bn) a year as a result of crazy trade with China. No more, he promised.\\n\\nOne of his central economic objectives has been to reduce it. In November 2017, his first year in office, he referred to the total deficit with all trade partners of almost $800bn a year as unacceptable. He said: \"We are going to start whittling that down, and as fast as possible\".\\n\\nRivals is a season of in-depth coverage on BBC News about the contest for supremacy between the US and China across trade, tech, defence and soft power.\\n\\nRead more here.\\n\\nBut it hasn\\'t come down. The figure that President Trump referred to was for trade in goods alone. It has increased in both of the full years since he took office.\\n\\nIt was $750bn in the final year under President Barack Obama, $887bn in 2018, and the increase has continued. We have figures for the first nine months of this year, showing the deficit was larger, though only slightly, than in the same period of 2018.\\n\\nMr Trump focuses on bilateral deficits, often suggesting they are evidence of the unfair actions of the other country concerned.\\n\\nThe deficit with China is by far the largest. It rose in Mr Trump\\'s first two years, but for the first nine months of 2019 it is lower. Both imports and exports have fallen, imports by more.\\n\\nImage copyright Getty Images Image caption President Trump believes the US is being unfairly treated by other countries when it comes to trade\\n\\nThat is hardly surprising as the two countries have applied increased tariffs to large swathes of one another\\'s goods.\\n\\nSo a success for President Trump? Only if you think bilateral trade balances really matter. And most economists think they don\\'t.\\n\\nGetting one bilateral deficit down does not guarantee you reduce the overall deficit. The deficit with China may be down, but others have increased - Vietnam, Mexico and Taiwan for example.\\n\\nGlobal Trade\\n\\nMore from the BBC\\'s series taking an international perspective on trade:\\n\\nPart of the underlying story is the fact that the trade balance with the rest of the world is mainly driven not by barriers that countries put in the way of one another\\'s goods.\\n\\nInstead, it\\'s about whether countries buy more goods and services than they produce. Prof Greg Mankiw of Harvard University (who used to be a supporter of the Republican Party) puts it like this: \"If you really want to reduce a trade deficit, the way to do it is to bring down spending relative to production, not to demonise trading partners around the world.\"\\n\\nImage copyright Getty Images Image caption President Trump\\'s tax cuts have given a boost to the US economy, though that may now be fading\\n\\nPresident Trump has, if anything, done just the opposite. His tax cuts have given a boost to the US economy, though that may now be fading. But it\\'s not really surprising that the trade deficit should rise as Americans - families and businesses - have had more to spend, and some of that money goes on imported goods.\\n\\nThere is an idea in economics known as the \"twin deficits hypothesis\", that there is a link between a government budget deficit and a trade deficit - or strictly speaking, a current account deficit that includes some financial transactions in addition to trade in goods and services.\\n\\nIt is by no means a settled debate, but the idea that tax cuts can in some circumstances lead to a larger trade deficit is entirely credible.\\n\\nSo there is a coherent story here that President Trump has taken steps - tax cuts - that make it harder to achieve something else he wants - a reduction in the trade deficit.\\n\\nThat\\'s not to say that President Trump isn\\'t on to something, in the sense that his views on trade may reflect real economic damage in some communities. The Nobel Prize winner Esther Duflo says there is among economists an \"instinctive view on trade, that it should be good for everyone\". But it\\'s not true she says.\\n\\nAlthough trade boosts growth overall, it does produce concentrated pockets of job losses, she says. That\\'s not a new view, and it doesn\\'t mean you can turn the clock back or reverse the losses by putting up new trade barriers.\\n  '},\n",

Budweiser makes specially-decorated cups to encourage non-binary and gender-fluid people to feel pride in their identity.\\n\\nThese examples of so-called \"woke capitalism\"- of corporations promoting progressive social causes - may feel ostentatiously up-to-the-moment. But woke capitalism is not as new as you might think.\\n\\nBack in 1850, social progress certainly had further to go.\\n\\nA couple of years earlier, American campaigner Elizabeth Cady Stanton had caused controversy at a women\\'s rights convention by calling for women to be given the vote. Even her supporters worried that it was too ambitious.\\n\\nImage copyright Getty Images\\n\\nMeanwhile, in Boston, a failed actor was trying to make his fortune as an inventor.\\n\\nHe had rented space in a workshop showroom, hoping to sell his machine for carving wooden type. But wooden type was falling out of fashion. The device was ingenious, but nobody wanted to buy one.\\n\\nThe workshop owner invited the demoralised inventor to take a look at another product which was also struggling: a sewing machine. It did not work very well. Nobody had succeeded in making one that did, despite many attempts for many decades.\\n\\nThe opportunity was clear. True, the time of a seamstress was not expensive - as the New York Herald said: \"We know of no class of workwomen who are more poorly paid for their work or who suffer more privation and hardship.\" But sewing took so much time - 14 hours for a single shirt - that there would be a fortune in speeding it up.\\n\\nAnd it was not only seamstresses who suffered: most wives and daughters were expected to sew. This \"never-ending, ever-beginning\" task, in the words of contemporary writer Sarah Hale, made their lives \"nothing but a dull round of everlasting toil\".\\n\\nIn that Boston workshop, the inventor sized up the machine he had been asked to admire, and quipped: \"You want to do away with the only thing that keeps women quiet.\"\\n\\n50 Things That Made the Modern Economy highlights the inventions, ideas and innovations that helped create the economic world.\\n\\nIt is broadcast on the BBC World Service. You can find more information about the programme\\'s sources and listen to all the episodes online or subscribe to the programme podcast.\\n\\nThat failed-actor-turned-inventor was Isaac Merritt Singer. He was flamboyant, charismatic, capable of great generosity - but ruthless, too.\\n\\nHe was an incorrigible womaniser who fathered at least 22 children.\\n\\nImage copyright Getty Images\\n\\nFor years he managed to run three families, not all of whom were aware the others existed, and all while technically still married to someone else entirely. At least one woman complained that he beat her.\\n\\nSinger was, in short, not a natural supporter of women\\'s rights - although his behaviour might have rallied some women to the cause.\\n\\nHis biographer, Ruth Brandon, dryly remarks that he was \"the kind of man who adds a certain backbone of solidity to the feminist movement\".\\n\\nSinger contemplated the prototype sewing machine.\\n\\n\"In place of the shuttle going round in a circle,\" he told the workshop owner, \"I would have it move to and fro in a straight line, and in place of the needle bar pushing a curved needle horizontally, I would have a straight needle moving up and down.\"\\n\\nSinger patented his tweaks, and started to sell his version of the machine. It was impressive: the first design that really worked. You could make a shirt in just an hour.\\n\\nImage copyright Getty Images Image caption The first Singer sewing machine was patented in 1851\\n\\nUnfortunately, it also relied on various other innovations which had already been patented by other inventors - such as the grooved, eye-pointed needle, to make a lock stitch, and the mechanism for feeding the cloth.\\n\\nDuring the so-called \"sewing machine war\" of the 1850s, rival manufacturers seemed to be more interested in suing each other for patent infringement than selling sewing machines.\\n\\nFinally, a lawyer banged their heads together, pointing out that between them were four lots of people who owned patents to all the elements needed to make a good machine. Why not license each other, and work together to sue everyone else?\\n\\nMore things that made the modern economy:\\n\\nFreed from legal distractions, the sewing machine market took off - and Singer came to dominate it. That might have surprised anyone who had seen how his factories compared with those of his rivals.\\n\\nOthers had rushed to embrace what was known as the \"American system\" of manufacturing, using bespoke tools and interchangeable parts. Yet Singer was late to this party: for years his machines were made from hand-filed parts and store-bought nuts and bolts.\\n\\nBut Singer and his canny business partner, Edward Clark, were pioneers in another way: marketing.\\n\\nSewing machines were expensive, costing several months\\' income for the average family.\\n\\nClark came up with the idea of hire purchase: families could rent the machine for a few dollars a month - and, when their rental payments totalled the purchase price, they would own it.\\n\\nImage copyright Getty Images\\n\\nIt helped overcome the bad reputation built up by the slower, less reliable machines of bygone years. So did Singer\\'s army of agents, who would set up the machine when you bought it, and call back to check it was working.\\n\\nStill, all these marketing efforts faced a problem. And that problem was misogyny.\\n\\nFor a flavour of the attitudes Stanton was up against, consider two cartoons. One shows a man asking why you would buy a \"sewing machine\" when you could simply marry one.\\n\\nIn another, a salesman says women will get more time to \"improve their intellects!\" The absurdity was understood.\\n\\nImage copyright Punch Cartoon Library / TopFoto\\n\\nSuch prejudice fuelled doubts that women could operate these expensive machines.\\n\\nSinger\\'s business depended on showing that they could, no matter how little respect he might have shown for the women in his own life.\\n\\nHe rented a shop window on Broadway in New York, and employed young women to demonstrate his machines - they drew quite a crowd.\\n\\nSinger\\'s adverts cast women as decision-makers: \"Sold only by the maker directly to the women of the family.\" They implied that women should aspire to financial independence: \"Any good female operator can earn with them $1,000 a year!\"\\n\\nBy 1860, the New York Times was gushing: no other invention had brought \"so great a relief for our mothers and daughters\". Seamstresses had found \"better remuneration and lighter toil\".\\n\\nImage copyright Getty Images Image caption A seamstress using a Singer sewing machine in 1907\\n\\nStill, the Times rather undercut its gender-conscious credentials by attributing all this to the \"inventive genius of man\".\\n\\nPerhaps we should ask a woman. Here\\'s Sarah Hale, from Godey\\'s Lady\\'s Book and Magazine in 1860: \"The needlewoman is… able to rest at night, and have time through the day for family occupations and enjoyments. Is this not a great gain for the world?\"\\n\\nThere are plenty of sceptics about \"woke capitalism\" today. It is all just a ruse to sell more beer and razors, isn\\'t it? Perhaps it is. Singer liked to say he cared only for the dimes.\\n\\nBut he is also proof that that social progress can be advanced by the most self-interested of motives.\\n\\nThe author writes the Financial Times\\'s Undercover Economist column. 50 Things That Made the Modern Economy is broadcast on the BBC World Service.

Better materials, more efficient shapes and improved coatings can all contribute to make engines lighter and stronger.\\n\\nHe also points out that lighter engines mean the aircraft structure can be lighter as it has to carry less weight.\\n\\nThose kind of incremental changes might not sound like much, but in the airline business they can make a big difference.\\n\\n\"Evolutionary changes, they sound unimpressive - 10% here 12% there. But in the airline business with very thin margins, that is the difference between life and death,\" says Richard Aboulafia, vice-president of analysis at the Teal Group.\\n\\nOne UK firm though is looking to make a step change in propulsion. Reaction Engines is developing a rocket engine, called Sabre, to be used on high-speed aircraft and on spacecraft.\\n\\nAt the kind of speeds Reaction is aiming for, Mach 5 (five times the speed of sound) the air coming into the engine can reach temperatures of 1,000C.\\n\\nImage copyright Reaction Engines Image caption Reaction Engines hopes its engines will allow travel at over five times the speed of sound\\n\\nThat temperature would destroy the engine, so Reaction has developed a cooling system which can chill the incoming air in a fraction of a second.\\n\\nThe so-called pre-cooler is made from miniature tubes, less than 1mm thick, that can pipe coolant under high pressure through the system, and whisk heat away.\\n\\n\"The Sabre is completely unique, there\\'s nobody else in the world, that we are aware of, that\\'s developing an air-breathing rocket engine,\" says Mark Thomas, chief executive of Reaction Engines.\\n\\n\"Our pre-cooler technology... is in a different class to anything out there. It\\'s ultra-high performance, ultra lightweight, highly miniaturised... it\\'s just in a different league completely.\"\\n\\nReaction Engines plans to start building the Sabre engine this year and test it in 2021.\\n\\nReaction\\'s pre-cooler can also potentially be used on conventional jet engines to make them more efficient, an idea being tested with Rolls-Royce.\\n\\nAccording to Prof Pericles it will be another 30 years until we see a radical change in passenger aircraft.\\n\\nBy then he thinks there will be a transition from the current design, which is basically a tube, with engines hanging below the wings, to a \"blended wing\" design.\\n\\nImage copyright Cranfield University Image caption In 30 years time aircraft might look more like this design from Cranfield University\\n\\nUnder that design, the aircraft is just one set of wings, with engines sitting on the top.\\n\\nThose engines might even by powered by hydrogen, which has the potential to be a very low emission fuel.\\n\\n\"Hydrogen fuel is unavoidable,\" says Prof Pilidis. \"It is a long-term solution to decarbonise aviation completely.\\n\\nHowever, environmentalists says action needs to be taken sooner.\\n\\n\"There\\'s always a role for technology to play in cutting emissions, but solving the climate crisis is something we need to get on with right now,\" says Jenny Bates, a campaigner at Friends of the Earth.\\n\\n\"The priority instead needs to be emissions cuts by having fewer planes in the sky.

For while there was a vast range on display, everything had one major thing in common - they were all certified kosher. Everything present conformed to kashrut, the Jewish dietary laws.\\n\\nImage copyright Dave Gordon Image caption Numerous drinks companies were in attendance\\n\\nThe event at the end of last year was the 31st annual \"Kosherfest\", a two-day gathering that touts itself as \"the world\\'s largest and most attended kosher-certified products trade show\".\\n\\nWhile Jewish-owned companies were proudly in attendance, many of the firms who were present are not owned or run by Jews, but had still chosen to go kosher. These included businesses from Pakistan, South Korea, Sri Lanka and Italy.\\n\\nWith the number of people attending up 800 from the year before, and 300 new products on display, Menachem Lubinsky, chief executive of event organiser Lubicom, said that demand for kosher food was growing strongly among non-Jewish shoppers.\\n\\n\"Kosher food appeals to a more health-conscious consumer,\" he says. \"It\\'s like a new generation of kosher. It\\'s different from those who have been there for many years, the basic kosher staples.\"\\n\\nImage copyright Dave Gordon Image caption Kosherfest has now been held for 31 years\\n\\nThe centre of the world\\'s kosher food sector is the US. For while only 2% of Americans are Jewish, some 7.5 million people, a study by the Quartz business news website found that 41% of all packaged food in the US is certified kosher.\\n\\nExplanations for this include a perception that kosher food is cleaner or healthier, or people\\'s desire for assurance than a product does not include potential allergens such as shellfish. It also offers certainty for vegans, such as in the example of Oreo cookies, which prior to their switch to kosher in the late 1990s contained lard (pork fat).\\n\\nGlobal Trade\\n\\nMore from the BBC\\'s series taking an international perspective on trade:\\n\\nLed by growing demand in the US, the global kosher food market is predicted to increase to almost $60bn (£40bn) of annual sales in 2025, up from $24bn in 2017. Given those vast figures, it is not surprising that a growing number of food businesses around the globe are seeking kosher accreditation.\\n\\n\"I think firms are coming from the basis that you can\\'t produce an ingredient anywhere in the world, and hope to sell it in the US, without being kosher,\" says Mr Lubinsky. \"There\\'s a significant market, and firms want a piece of it.\"\\n\\nImage copyright Getty Images Image caption A kosher certified product that is marked \"parve\" contains no meat or diary\\n\\nBut what exactly is kosher food? While most people understand that pork and shellfish are non-kosher, kosher animals such as cows and lambs need to be ritually slaughtered with a sharp knife. Meanwhile, food products cannot contain both meat and dairy. And not all parts of the cow can be consumed.\\n\\nAll kosher rulings have to be carried out by trained rabbis from a kosher certification agency. Richard Rabkin, managing director of COR, the largest such organisation in Canada, explains that the process is taken very seriously.\\n\\n\"Some people have this mistaken impression that we go there and bless the food, and that\\'s all it takes,\" he says. \"No, it is more complicated than that.\\n\\n\"We have an initial conversation with a company and get an impression of what they\\'re doing in the food, and take a look at all the ingredients, and find out whether it\\'s kosher or not. Once we have a picture of that, then we inspect the facility itself... We are guarding against cross contamination.\\n\\n\"Once we ensure all of that, there\\'s an inspection to make sure everything is followed according to kosher standards, and then certification\\'s granted. [But], inspection isn\\'t just time to time, it\\'s an ongoing basis.\"\\n\\nImage copyright Dave Gordon Image caption Elli Kriel runs a kosher business in the United Arab Emirates\\n\\nBack at Kosherfest in New Jersey, Dakshin Thilina was representing Sri Lankan food group Nexpo Conversion, and its kosher dried coconut milk powder and coconut oil.

But it only covers the easier aspects of their difficult relationship, and only removes some of the tariffs.\\n\\nThe biggest hurdles are still to come, and could stand in the way of a second phase agreement - one that would in theory remove all of the tariffs, bringing some much needed relief for the global economy, which is in the interests of all of us.\\n\\nWhat\\'s not in the phase one deal tells us where the flashpoints are in the US-China relationship - and what could derail the second round of negotiations.\\n\\nSo what didn\\'t make it into the agreement?\\n\\n1. Industrial subsidies and \\'Made in China 2025\\'\\n\\nThe deal doesn\\'t address Beijing\\'s ambitious \\'Made in China 2025\\' programme, which is designed to help Chinese companies excel and become world-class leaders in emerging technologies. It also doesn\\'t address the subsidies that China gives its state-owned enterprises, says Paul Triolo of the Eurasia Group.\\n\\nMedia playback is unsupported on your device Media caption What is Beijing planning with its \"Made in China 2025\" programme?\\n\\nWashington sees \"Made in China 2025\" as a direct threat to its supremacy in tech, saying that Chinese companies have only caught up with American ones - at times outpacing them - because they get unfair and outsized assistance from the Chinese government in the form of subsidies.\\n\\nThese were amongst the thorniest issues the Trump administration had with China, but they\\'ve been pushed to the phase two process Mr Triolo says, along with \"market access in sectors such as cloud services, cyber security and data governance issues\".\\n\\nBeijing maintains it doesn\\'t unfairly subsidise these industries or companies, but the reality is China isn\\'t going to give up dominance in these sectors so easily.\\n\\n2. Huawei\\n\\nThe trade deal won\\'t reduce US pressure on Huawei, the Chinese telecoms giant that has been caught in the crossfire of the trade war, with the US Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin saying the company isn\\'t a \"chess piece\" in the negotiations.\\n\\nThat will disappoint both Huawei and the Chinese government which have been furious over how Washington has linked the company\\'s fate to the relationship between the US and China.\\n\\nThe Chinese firm became a symbol of the US-China tech rivalry and Washington has been lobbying its allies - including the UK - to not use Huawei\\'s 5G technology services in critical communications infrastructure, alleging it could be used by Beijing to spy on customers. Huawei has denied this and had hoped that if the US-China relationship improved, its fortunes would too.\\n\\nAnalysts tell me that\\'s unlikely. With the signing of this agreement, there\\'s a clear separation between national security and trade, and Huawei and other Chinese companies should still expect the pressure on them to continue. So expect more American export bans not just on Huawei, but on several more Chinese companies and increased US scrutiny on Chinese investments abroad.\\n\\n3. Access for foreign financial services firms\\n\\nWhile the agreement does talk about opening up market access for financial services firms, some analysts have said it doesn\\'t go far enough to ensure they have equal market access.\\n\\nChina had already publicly said that it was opening up its financial services sector, and has recently allowed foreign companies to have a bigger stake in Chinese firms. But Beijing isn\\'t giving up much by doing that, because China\\'s financial services sector is now dominated by domestic digital payment players.\\n\\nEven if US payment firms do have greater market access to the Chinese market, it\\'s hard to see how they might be able to compete. Whether China sincerely applies its commitments to treat foreign and domestic firms equally will also be watched closely by the Trump administration, and this could be a potential area where the rapprochement could be derailed.\\n\\n4. Enforcement and interpretation\\n\\nThe deal has a dispute resolution mechanism in place, which basically requires China - once a complaint has been made - to begin consultations with the US, with the onus on Beijing to resolve it.\\n\\nBut what the deal leaves out is \"how the US is going to monitor enforcement,\" says Derek Scissors of the American Enterprise Institute.\\n\\n\"American firms don\\'t like to report intellectual property theft,\" he told me.\"So in the first instance what mechanism is the US using to gather information on this. All that is in the document is consultations.\"\\n\\nMedia playback is unsupported on your device Media caption How the US-China trade war has changed the world\\n\\nThe deal also leaves out how the two sides will interpret these key aspects of the agreement. Already, there are signs of differences. Chinese state media has suggested the dispute resolution mechanism isn\\'t dictated by the US - not entirely in keeping with Washington\\'s messaging.\\n\\nThis could indicate that even though there is an agreement in place, Beijing might ignore it, as Dan Harris of the China Law blog points out.\\n\\n\"The problem isn\\'t the law,\" he says. \"It\\'s that when something is important to China - some cutting edge technology that it wants - then those laws don\\'t have any use at all.\"\\n\\n5. Further reductions in tariffs\\n\\nThe deal doesn\\'t include a definitive timeline on when the tariffs that are still in place will go down.\\n\\nAccording to research from the Peterson Institute for International Economics, average tariffs on both sides are still up about 20% from pre-trade war levels - six times higher than when the dispute began. That means companies and consumers are still paying more.\\n\\nMedia playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Who really pays in a tariff war?\\n\\nAdmittedly, the Trump administration has left the threat of tariffs in place as a stick to beat China with - in case Beijing doesn\\'t keep to its commitments.\\n\\nAnd there\\'s always that risk, as China\\'s hard line Communist Party mouth-piece the Global Times points out: \"Can a preliminary trade agreement, reached during a period when China-US strategic relations are clearly declining, really work? Will it be replaced by new conflicts or further progress as negotiations continue?\"\\n\\nThe potential for trade tensions to resume on both sides is still a very big possibility.\\n  '},\n",

              "  'text': '\\n   Image copyright Getty Images\\n\\nJust a year after being rescued, Flybe\\'s future is again in doubt.\\n\\nSome have blamed fundamental problems with the business model, others bad management, competitive pressures, unfair taxes, or the vagaries of the oil and currency markets. In truth, it\\'s a combination of all these, and more.\\n\\nThe firm\\'s boss Mark Anderson has told staff that the firm still has a bright future ahead of it.\\n\\nBut Flybe has been in financial turmoil for years, and there are arguments that if current investors Virgin Atlantic (49%-owned by Delta Air Lines), Cyrus Capital Partners, and Stobart Group, can\\'t make it work, who can?\\n\\nThe government sees enough value in Flybe to (surprisingly, perhaps) help with a rescue. So, how did we get here? And, crucially, is good money just being thrown after bad?\\n\\nWhen did Flybe\\'s troubles begin?\\n\\nThe Exeter-based airline\\'s problems did not just emerge this month. It has long-suffered from overcapacity and rising costs.\\n\\nThere was a profit warning in 2017, with higher maintenance costs blamed as a major part of the problem.\\n\\nAnother profit warning in 2018 said Flybe would sink to a £22m loss, with the airline saying falling consumer demand, a weaker pound and higher fuel costs were the cause.\\n\\nFlybe, then listed on the stock market, saw its shares tumble 46% in a single day.\\n\\nNevertheless, then chief executive Christine Ourmieres-Widener said: \"We continue to strengthen the underlying business and remain confident that our strategy will improve performance.\"\\n\\nIn November 2018, two weeks after that optimistic assessment, Flybe announced it was putting itself up for sale. The airline said it was \"in discussions with a number of strategic operators about a potential sale\" and could cut more flights.\\n\\nFlybe was bought by Connect Airways - the consortium that includes Virgin Atlantic, Cyrus Capital and Stobart Group - in February last year.\\n\\nNow a private company, the Flybe group is not due to file its next set of profit and loss figures with Companies House until 4 April. And these accounts will only deal with the airline\\'s profitability in the period to 4 July, 2019.\\n\\nBut given Connect Airways went cap-in-hand to the government for help, it\\'s safe to say that the airline\\'s financial position has worsened.\\n\\nImage copyright Getty Images\\n\\nWhat is Flybe\\'s business model?\\n\\nFlybe is a regional airline, which means it operates smaller aircraft and generally serves communities and airports that are too small to attract the big names in the aviation industry.\\n\\nAgainst the likes of Ryanair or British Airways, Flybe is a minnow.\\n\\nThis is both a blessing and a curse.\\n\\nBeing able to reach the places that other airlines don\\'t is seen as vital for regional connectivity. Exeter MP Ben Bradshaw went so far as to describe Flybe as a UK strategic asset. On some routes the competition is really only rail or ferry, not other airlines.\\n\\nAnd in a country where costly infrastructure projects such as HS2 and Crossrail take an eternity to build, Flybe has provided a nimble solution to tough transport problems. For example, some 68% of Belfast airport flights, and 90% of Southampton\\'s, are operated by Flybe.\\n\\nThe trouble is, Flybe can get \"sandwiched\" between the business model of budget airlines such as Ryanair and EasyJet, and the network carriers such as British Airways that use short-haul flights to connect with their long-haul services.\\n\\nIf Flybe\\'s routes to secondary and tertiary locations prove successful, the bigger players are likely to move in, operating the services at lower costs.\\n\\nIt does not help that many Flybe routes are within the UK, where, the airline has long complained, it is at a tax disadvantage.\\n\\nAir Passenger Duty (APD) is a levy paid on each leg of the journey within the UK - departure and arrival. For international flights, it is only paid on the outbound ticket.\\n\\nAPD is thought to cost Flybe more than £100m a year.\\n\\nImage copyright Getty Images\\n\\nWhat do we know about the rescue?\\n\\nGiven that Prime Minister Boris Johnson has made improving \"regional connectivity\" a key part of his industrial plan for the UK, seeing a regional airline go bust probably would not have looked good.\\n\\nFor days after Sky News broke the story that Flybe was on the brink of collapse and had lined up an administrator, the company declined to say anything meaningful about its plight. Then it emerged that the Connect consortium was in talks with the government about a rescue deal.\\n\\nDetails remain sketchy, but this is what we know.\\n\\nFlybe may get a deferral on its APD, and the government will review the whole duty structure\\n\\nThe Connect Airways consortium will inject another £30m into the business\\n\\nThere have been talks about a short-term loan to tie over Flybe until it is on a firmer financial footing\\n\\nThis has raised many unanswered questions. Why is a Conservative government propping up failing companies? Is it right to rescue Flybe when there was no help for Thomas Cook and other collapsed businesses such as Carillion? Does it disadvantage other airlines? Is there a breach of state aid rules? Also, isn\\'t APD supposed to limit flying and help meet Britain\\'s climate change targets?\\n\\nHow do rivals feel about the rescue?\\n\\nThere has been a mixture of outrage and concern among Flybe\\'s rivals.\\n\\nWillie Walsh, chief executive of British Airways\\' owner IAG, called it a \"blatant misuse of public funds\" that \"constitute unlawful state aid\". He has filed a complaint with Brussels.\\n\\nEasyJet boss Johan Lundgren said that taxpayers cash should not be used to bail out a business with well-funded backers such as Virgin and Delta. And Ryanair said in a statement that the government should not \"favour a financially profligate airline\". Ryanair has threatened legal action against the government.\\n\\nThe Rail Delivery Group, which represents train operators, said any review of APD \"that encourages more people to fly domestically would limit efforts to tackle the climate crisis\".\\n\\nThe Chancellor, Sajid Javid, along with Business Secretary Andrea Leadsom and Transport Secretary Grant Shapps, have all been closely involved in the rescue plan.\\n\\nThe word from these departments, and also Number 10, is that the final terms of the rescue will be done in a fiscally responsible way that will neither neither breach state aid rules nor climate change targets.\\n\\nThe Prime Minister\\'s spokesman said \"there has been no state aid to Flybe,\" adding that \"any future funding will be made on strictly commercial terms\".\\n\\nAccording to Mr Shapps: \"The actions we have taken will support and enhance regional connectivity across the UK, so local communities have the domestic transport connections they rely on.\"\\n\\nImage copyright Getty Images\\n\\nWhat is the future for Flybe?\\n\\nFlybe has been through several restructurings over the past decade, suggesting there have been fundamental problems for years. The Connect consortium has not managed to knock the airline into shape in the relatively short time it has owned it. And many people believe that the government can provide only a short-term fix.\\n\\nThe government can\\'t do much about global oil prices and currency swings. An economic slowdown in the UK and the rest of Europe will pile pressure on an already weak airline.\\n\\nAccording to analyst John Grant, Flybe\\'s fragmented network and relatively small number of daily flights means it is difficult to achieve critical mass and means the airline is exposed to short-term changes in market conditions.\\n\\nHe says: \"Regional can be good; a closeness to customers, brand loyalty, minimal direct competition and a perception that high air fares are paid by all. The reality can be quite different; network fragmentation, numerous crew bases, high operational exposure and ultimately quite small catchment areas.\"\\n\\nThe acquisition by Virgin (and through it, Delta) will possibly help feed Flybe\\'s passenger traffic onto these network carriers but it has clearly not made much of a difference yet.\\n\\nOne rumour is that the government considered extending so-called public service obligations to a number of Flybe routes that were particularly important to regional communities. That, in effect, means subsidising them - always a controversial move.\\n\\nBut until full details of what is planned are disclosed, analysts say it is difficult to know whether Flybe can be put on a firmer footing.\\n\\nThreats of legal action could only delay matters. And one thing Flybe doesn\\'t have is time.\\n  '},\n",

Edward, who became the Duke of Windsor, requested a set of coins but was refused by his brother, George VI.\\n\\nNow, four of the set are with museums and institutions, with two in private hands. The latest owner, a sovereign collector who wished to remain anonymous, said: \"When the opportunity came along, I felt I could not turn it down. It was a once in a lifetime opportunity.\\n\\n\"I\\'m aware that [£1m] is a lot of money for a coin, but if I did not secure it now, I\\'d not get the chance again.\"\\n\\nQuirk of vanity\\n\\nThe coin was last sold for a then-record £516,000 to a US collector in 2014, revealing its status on both sides of the Atlantic.\\n\\nWhat fascinates collectors and historians is not only its rarity, but also that Edward VIII was willing to break with a convention that went back centuries to Charles II.\\n\\nThis saw each monarch face the opposite direction to their predecessor. Edward preferred his left profile, partly owing to his hair parting, and insisted on the portrait facing, in effect, the wrong way.\\n\\n\"Edward VIII is quite a vain character. He insisted on facing the same way as his father, because he believed that was his best side,\" said Chris Barker, from the Royal Mint Museum.\\n\\nGeorge VI, who succeeded him, also showed his left profile, keeping to tradition as if Edward had not broken the sequence.\\n\\nHow the sale happened\\n\\nHow do you value a coin so sought-after and so rare? The Royal Mint, the Treasury-owned business which strikes coins for nations around the world, set up a service two years ago aiming to find and authenticate coins and precious metals.\\n\\nIts state-of-the-art lab, at the Mint in South Wales, contains x-ray machines and other technology that can easily spot a fake.\\n\\nThis collector services division acted as the go-between for the sale, for a cut of the price. Its experts found that the coin could be for sale, contacted the collector of sovereigns, and effectively acted as a broker for the deal.\\n\\nRebecca Morgan, head of the service, said: \"The Royal Mint has an unbroken record of minting for 1,100 years so we\\'re uniquely placed to source historic, British coins for our customers.\\n\\n\"They can feel confident that it has been through the authentication checks and they have paid a fair price for it.\"\\n\\nThe Mint may have helped to secure a record sale for a UK coin, ahead of a Queen Anne Vigo five guinea coin, but it is still a long way short of the world record.\\n\\nThe flowing hair dollar coin, the first issued by the US government, fetched more than $10m (£7.5m) at auction in 2013.\\n  '},\n",

His band, The Answer, had sold hundreds of thousands of records and had toured the globe with the likes of The Rolling Stones, The Who and AC/DC.\\n\\nBut the singer\\'s world was shaken to the core when his wife, Louise, gave birth to a very premature baby at just 27 weeks.\\n\\n\"It was an unbelievably dark and troubled time,\" says Neeson.\\n\\nTheir son, Dabhog, was born weighing just 1lb 12ozs (0.8 kg) and was immediately taken into intensive care. He stayed in hospital in Belfast for the next four months.\\n\\n\"For a large portion of that time we weren\\'t sure on a daily basis whether he was going to make it through,\" Neeson adds.\\n\\nTwo weeks into that time they had to deal with the news that Dabhog had Down\\'s syndrome - a genetic condition that typically affects a person\\'s learning abilities.\\n\\n\"That was something else that just added to the whole very intense experience.\"\\n\\nImage copyright Cormac Neeson Image caption Dabhog underwent heart surgery aged one\\n\\nAround that time The Answer were releasing an album.\\n\\n\"I would have to take myself away from the incubator for 20 or 30 minutes and do interviews to promote the album.\\n\\n\"I had to pretty much pretend I was in a place where I was comfortable releasing good time rock \\'n\\' roll music. It was a complete collision course with where my head was actually at,\" Neeson says.\\n\\nDabhog did survive and was discharged from hospital, although he had to have surgery aged one to fix a hole in his heart.\\n\\nThe experiences have had a profound effect on Neeson\\'s outlook on life and his music.\\n\\n\"Whenever the dust settled and Dabhog was home and his health started to turn and life settled down a bit I realised that creatively I was not in a place where I could genuinely write the kind of music we had spent the last 10 years writing,\" he says.\\n\\nHe went to Nashville where he worked with American songwriters and musicians to put together a new album. \"The result was really a collection of songs that was so introspective and intense and so truthful that they really could only be part of a solo project.\\n\\n\"It\\'s a world away from the stuff that I had spent my career making up till that point.\"\\n\\nImage copyright Helena Neeson Image caption The title of Neeson\\'s solo album, White Feather, came from an event during his wife\\'s pregnancy\\n\\nOne of the songs, Broken Wing, is a tribute to Dabhog.\\n\\n\"It\\'s a good opportunity to talk about Down\\'s syndrome and normalise what Down\\'s syndrome is, but also to celebrate my son for being the individual that he is,\" Neeson says.\\n\\nHe says he wanted to get over in the song that raising a child with a learning disability has a unique set of challenges, but \"it\\'s unique in a really great and powerful way\".\\n\\nNeeson says he also wrote the song to help new parents of children with Down\\'s syndrome.\\n\\n\"I was kind of placing myself back in the hospital whenever we were told that Dabhog had Down\\'s syndrome and I was thinking that if I\\'d heard this song back then I might have taken some comfort from it.\\n\\n\"If your child has Down\\'s syndrome that is not what defines your child.

The most common form of Down\\'s syndrome is Trisomy 21, when there are three copies of that chromosome instead of two\\n\\nThe album\\'s title, White Feather, is a reference to an incident early in Louise\\'s pregnancy with Dabhog.\\n\\nAt around three weeks they were told it was as an ectopic pregnancy, when a fertilised egg is implanted outside the womb, often in a fallopian tube. The egg cannot then develop into a baby and the pregnancy has to be terminated due to the risk to the mother\\'s health.\\n\\nAfter taking Louise into surgery the doctors realised it was not an ectopic pregnancy, but said they would have to wait another two weeks before being able to scan for a heartbeat and confirm if the baby was still alive.\\n\\nThe night before the scan, Neeson went for a walk by himself in the hills near his hometown of Newcastle, County Down.\\n\\n\"A lot of soul searching went on. I said out loud, \\'I need a sign\\'. At that point I was stopped dead in my tracks.\"\\n\\nHe had spotted a white feather in the trees. \"In Ireland a white feather represents life,\" Neeson says.\\n\\nThe next day the scan revealed a \"gigantic\" heartbeat.\\n\\nImage copyright Shona Cutt Image caption Neeson\\'s band The Answer have released six studio albums\\n\\nDabhog is now five and in September started school, where Neeson says he has made friends and won certificates for being pupil of the week.\\n\\n\"Just to be able to experience our little boy thriving like that and being so communicative and being such a life-affirming character and for him to bring so much joy into our lives, it\\'s a massively positive experience for us and we\\'re thankful for that,\" Neeson says.\\n\\nDabhog now has a younger brother and Neeson has become an ambassador for the learning disability charity Mencap in Northern Ireland. Dabhog attended a Mencap centre in Belfast for specialist learning and early intervention support.\\n\\n\"Before my wife became pregnant with Dabhog I suppose my sole focus in life was essentially myself and I think you become much less selfish when you have a child,\" he says.\\n\\nLooking back to 2014, he adds: \"There are moments in your life when you don\\'t know how you\\'re going to get past these obstacles that are set, but you do.\\n\\n\"Whenever you come out the other side there\\'s a real sense of victory and that\\'s where we are at now.\"\\n\\nFollow us on Facebook, or on Twitter @BBCNewsEnts.

But when it came to researching the role of Kelly, Theron explains: \"I didn\\'t meet her, by choice.\\n\\n\"Listen, the whole thing is pretty overwhelming,\" she continues. \"It took me a while to wrap my head around playing her for many reasons. But I think the biggest one is that she\\'s so well known. And it\\'s contemporary, it\\'s of this moment, and whether you like her or not, you know her face, you know what she sounds like, and there was really no getting around that.\"\\n\\nTheron has been praised by critics not only for her acting performance, but also for her physical likeness to Kelly, which was achieved with the help of prosthetics from make-up artist Kazu Hiro.\\n\\n\"The transformation is so authentic, so on point, it\\'s unnerving,\" said Empire\\'s editor Terri White.\\n\\n\"The first thing you notice about her deep-dive performance as Megyn Kelly is that you don\\'t see Theron at all,\" agreed Peter Travers in Rolling Stone. \"Through voice, posture, wardrobe, and the genius prosthetic make-up, Theron is Kelly.\"\\n\\nImage copyright Lionsgate\\n\\nTheron, who also co-produced the film, explains she wrestled with Kelly\\'s politics before she agreed to the role.\\n\\n\"There are things she\\'s said in the past that have bothered me,\" Theron says. (Kelly\\'s previous controversies include her defence of people dressing in blackface as a character for Halloween and her comments about Santa Claus being white.)\\n\\n\"But the more I zeroed in on what the film was, [I realised] it wasn\\'t a Megyn Kelly biopic, it\\'s about a year-and-a-half at Fox, and she was a part of many other women who experienced this thing and then ultimately succeeded in doing something that was thought of as impossible.\\n\\n\"And so once I narrowed it down to that, it became easier for me to make it about that, and whether I have issues with her or not, she was part of something that will I think be a historical marker for women\\'s rights.\"\\n\\nAiles was fired from Fox News as a result of the allegations, receiving $40m (£31m) in severance pay. He died a year later, aged 77. Several women who filed lawsuits against him received damages from Fox News.\\n\\nThe fact that the Ailes scandal pre-dated #MeToo makes it all the more significant, as the climate was not what it became a year later, when allegations against movie mogul Harvey Weinstein sparked the movement which would bring down several big-screen heavyweights.\\n\\nImage copyright Getty/Lionsgate Image caption Roger Ailes (left) died in 2017. He is played in the film by John Lithgow (seen with Theron)\\n\\nThe film largely keeps things focused on the scandal and doesn\\'t venture into being a study of the goings on at a right-wing news channel.\\n\\n\"Is Bombshell hard enough on Fox News? Difficult to gauge, because it\\'s so much more focused on the internal culture than the product they put out in the world,\" wrote Alison Willmore in Vulture.\\n\\n\"The film presents familiar figures as waxlike caricatures,\" she wrote, adding: \"When it comes to Trump, the movie is oddly unspecific about the role Fox News played in the election.\"\\n\\nBut perhaps that doesn\\'t matter, given how resonant the film feels as a result of its focus on sexual harassment.\\n\\n\"This conversation is happening in real time, and I think without that this movie wouldn\\'t have the power that it does,\" acknowledges Theron.\\n\\n\"It was really strange to make the film and to slowly see these things all kind of unravel. I remember sitting in the make-up trailer and watching male actors talk negatively about this movement, that they thought was dangerous and was excluding men and was over-correcting, and it was infuriating.\\n\\n\"The Harvey [Weinstein] thing happened and that was really big, and when the tapes of the women were released, I think that\\'s when we realised that we were part of telling a story which was somewhat the origin story of this whole movement, and we didn\\'t know that before.\"\\n\\nHow does she respond to those suggestions that it has led to over-correcting? \"I mean, listen, I feel like, in context, when you really look at it at from 30,000 feet in the sky, what\\'s happened to women in toxic workplaces for years and years, a little over-correcting is the least we can do,\" Theron says.\\n\\nImage copyright Getty Images Image caption Charlize Theron was nominated for best drama actress at the Golden Globes earlier this month\\n\\nConsidering Kelly isn\\'t well known in the UK, and Fox News isn\\'t consumed widely, is Theron aware that Bombshell could be a harder sell for British audiences?\\n\\n\"Totally, of course, we have all of those conversations,\" she replies. \"But then you realise that you guys have the linchpin, Rupert Murdoch,\" she says, referring to Fox\\'s ultimate chief, who also owns British newspapers including The Times and The Sun. \"So I think that\\'s enough information, that\\'s all you need to know.\\n\\n\"You don\\'t really need to know anything about Fox,\" she continues. \"Because this is such a non-partisan... this is not a political film, it\\'s not about Fox per se, really it\\'s just the time and the place in the world. This is something which I think is reflected in so many different workplaces.\\n\\nBefore we leave, we ask which news outlets Theron consumes herself.\\n\\n\"CNN,\" she replies initially. \"But I also like to have varied news sources, I watch a lot of right-wing political shows and news programmes because I think it is important for us to see how the other guy is talking. So there\\'s never been a part of me that\\'s just like \\'don\\'t want to see it, don\\'t want to hear it, only want to get what I believe\\'.\\n\\n\"I think it\\'s hard to have any kind of real conversation about real issues unless you really know where the other person is coming from, what ground they\\'re standing on. You have to be willing to listen. I think a lot of the time we just want to state what we believe and the importance of that, and we don\\'t listen enough.\"\\n\\nBombshell is released in the UK and Ireland on Friday 17 January.\\n  '},\n",

Going backwards on diversity?\\n\\nImage copyright AFP Image caption Lupita Nyong\\'o missed out on a nomination for Us\\n\\nNineteen of the 20 acting nominees this year are white - the highest number since the #OscarsSoWhite outcries of 2015 and 2016, when there was a total whitewash.\\n\\nAfter three actors of colour won golden statuettes in 2019, this year the main films in the awards race have largely not been those that are telling diverse stories with diverse casts.\\n\\nThe Oscar nominations come a week after the Baftas announced an all-white line-up of acting nominations. Embarrassingly for Bafta, the one black star up for an Oscar is a Brit.\\n\\nThat is Cynthia Erivo, who made her name across the Atlantic on Broadway and is now nominated for playing slave-turned-abolitionist Harriet Tubman in Harriet.\\n\\nBut there is still much unrest that this year\\'s list is not more diverse. There was evidently no space for Lupita Nyong\\'o for Us, Golden Globe winner Awkwafina for The Farewell, or Eddie Murphy for Dolemite Is My Name, to name but three. In fact, all three films were shut out entirely.\\n\\nMeanwhile, some are pointing out that there was room to nominate Scarlett Johansson twice, for best actress for Marriage Story and best supporting actress for Jojo Rabbit - her first Oscar nominations.\\n\\nSkip Twitter post by @TonyRevolori I used to defend the #OscarNoms because it starts in the studio system making Women and POC films to be able to be nominated.

Erivo in line for an EGOT\\n\\nImage copyright Universal Image caption Cynthia Erivo is nominated twice for Harriet - best actress and best song\\n\\nIf Erivo does win, she will become only the second black best actress winner - after Halle Berry in 2002.\\n\\nNot only that, but at 33 she will become the youngest person to become an EGOT - the winner of Emmy, Grammy, Oscar and Tony Awards - according to the Los Angeles Times.\\n\\nShe won the Tony in 2016 for starring in The Color Purple on Broadway, and the Grammy for the show\\'s cast recording. She got a Daytime Emmy for a cast performance on NBC\\'s Today (although the paper points out some people don\\'t count Daytime Emmys towards an EGOT).\\n\\nAnd she has two shots at an Oscar this year. As well as being up for best actress, she is nominated for best song for writing Stand Up, which appears in Harriet.\\n\\n4. Jenny from the block is blocked\\n\\nImage copyright Reuters Image caption Jennifer Lopez at the Golden Globe Awards\\n\\nJennifer Lopez won\\'t make it from \"the block\" (that\\'s somewhere in the Bronx) to Hollywood Boulevard on Oscars night.\\n\\nShe had been among the favourites to be nominated for best supporting actress for Hustlers, the true story of a ring of women who drugged and swindled rich men at strip clubs.\\n\\nIt would also have been rare recognition for a Latin American performer.\\n\\nInstead, Kathy Bates - who had been a relative outsider - got the nod for Clint Eastwood\\'s controversial film Richard Jewell. It\\'s her fourth nomination, and her first since 2003.\\n\\nStill, at least all the praise J-Lo has received for her role probably means she won\\'t have to face the indignity of adding to her tally of 10 nominations for the Golden Raspberries - for the worst films of the year.\\n\\n5. Rocketman fails to launch\\n\\nImage copyright Reuters Image caption Sir Elton John is nominated, but Taron Egerton is not\\n\\nAfter Rami Malek won best actor for playing Queen singer Freddie Mercury in Bohemian Rhapsody last year, it looked like Taron Egerton might follow that path with a best actor nomination for playing Sir Elton John in Rocketman.\\n\\nBut despite winning a Golden Globe last week, the British actor has missed out on an Oscar nod. In fact, it looks like he was edged out by a fellow Welshman, with Jonathan Pryce sneaking in to get his first Oscar nomination at the age of 72 for The Two Popes.\\n\\nRocketman got one nomination - for Sir Elton himself and Bernie Taupin for best original song for (I\\'m Gonna) Love Me Again - but missed out on categories like costume design, make-up and hair, and sound mixing, for which it had been tipped.\\n\\n6. Beyonce\\'s Spirit is broken\\n\\nImage copyright Getty Images Image caption Beyonce at the Lion King premiere\\n\\nNot only have the Oscars missed the chance to get Jennifer Lopez on the red carpet, but they have also passed up the opportunity to give Beyonce a ticket.\\n\\nShe was thought likely to be in the running for best song for Spirit from The Lion King, but it was not to be.\\n\\nThat category also contained a hope for a song called Glasgow, sung by rising Irish star Jessie Buckley in Wild Rose. That too was shut out. But she\\'ll surely get to the Oscars in an acting capacity before too long.\\n\\n7. Frozen II frozen out\\n\\nImage copyright Disney\\n\\nSix years ago, Frozen won two Oscars - best animated feature and best song for Let It Go (of course).\\n\\nThis time, the sequel is nominated for best song, for Into the Unknown - but it\\'s been left out in the cold when it comes to the best animation category.\\n\\nThat category does include Toy Story 4, Missing Link, How to Train Your Dragon: The Hidden World, I Lost My Body and Klaus. The latter is a Netflix Christmas animation, and its inclusion is a big surprise.\\n\\n8. The return of the Oscar darlings\\n\\nImage copyright Getty Images Image caption Al Pacino pictured the last time he was nominated for an Oscar, in 1993\\n\\nA number of past Oscar favourites have been welcomed back into the fold.\\n\\nAl Pacino now has nine career nominations, with the latest coming for his turn as union king Jimmy Hoffa in Martin Scorsese\\'s The Irishman. It\\'s his first since 1993, when he was up twice (and won for Scent of a Woman).\\n\\nSir Anthony Hopkins has his first nomination since 1998, and his fifth overall, for The Two Popes.\\n\\nTom Hanks was once Mr Oscar and has won twice, but remarkably his nomination for A Beautiful Day in the Neighborhood is his first nod since 2001 (for Cast Away).\\n\\nRenee Zellweger is favourite to scoop best actress for playing Judy Garland in Judy - her first nomination since she was shortlisted for three years in a row from 2002-04.\\n\\nAnd Charlize Theron is nominated for Bombshell - her first nod since North Country in 2006.\\n\\n9. A country for old men\\n\\nImage copyright Getty Images Image caption Al Pacino pictured at the Critics\\' Choice Awards on Sunday\\n\\nIn the best supporting actor category, the average age of the nominees is 71. Brad Pitt is the baby at 56, and will go up against Hanks (63), Joe Pesci (76), Al Pacino (79) and Sir Anthony (82).\\n\\nEven across both male acting categories, the average age is 60, whereas the average age of nominated actresses is 40.

A re-examination of his brain in 2014 found he had died from chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE). That is a brain condition normally linked to boxing which has been linked to memory loss, depression and dementia. It has been seen in other contact sports.\\n\\nA coroner ruled that Mr Astle\\'s brain had been damaged by years of heading heavy leather footballs.\\n\\nIn February 2017, researchers from University College London (UCL) and Cardiff University published a study based on post-mortem examinations of the brains of six former players which found signs of CTE in four cases.\\n\\nProf Huw Morris, of UCL, told the BBC at the time: \"We saw the sorts of changes that are seen in ex-boxers, the changes that are often associated with repeated brain injury. So really for the first time in a series of players we have shown that there is evidence that head injury has occurred earlier in their life, which presumably has some impact on them developing dementia.\"\\n\\nThen last year, a study by Glasgow University found former professional footballers are three-and-a-half times more likely to die of dementia than people of the same age range in the general population.\\n\\nHowever, there is no definitive evidence that heading a ball does cause dementia. That would require long-term research.\\n\\nWhy is it difficult to prove a link?\\n\\nThe causes of dementia are complex and it is likely that the condition is caused by a combination of age, lifestyle and genetic factors.\\n\\nPhysical trauma to the brain is certainly a factor, but an unhealthy lifestyle, such as smoking, drinking too much alcohol and being overweight are also known risk factors.\\n\\nTeasing out how all those factors might come into play is immensely difficult.\\n\\nMedia playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Dementia in football: Alan Shearer undergoes MRI scan\\n\\nWhat research is under way?\\n\\nThe London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine (LSHTM), Queen Mary University of London and the Institute of Occupational Medicine have launched a study of 300 former professional footballers.\\n\\nThe plan is to put the ex-players, aged between 50 and 85, through a series of tests designed to assess their physical and cognitive capabilities.\\n\\nData will also be gathered on the players\\' careers in the game and lifestyle factors.\\n\\nThis will allow comparisons between defenders and centre-forwards and other players who tend to head the ball less often.\\n\\nThe test results will be compared with those from a general population study known as the 1946 Birth Cohort, which has monitored the ageing process in a group born in that year.\\n\\nLead researcher Prof Neil Pearce, from LSHTM, said: \"We don\\'t know much about the risks from concussion in football, and we know almost nothing about the long-term effects from heading the ball repeatedly.\\n\\n\"This study will provide, for the first time, persuasive evidence of the long-term effects on cognitive function from professional football.\"\\n  '},\n",

Many go well.\\n\\nBut the Victoria Derbyshire programme has heard from nearly 300 people who have experienced complications - including chronic pain, infections and organ perforations.\\n\\nInternational guidelines estimate one in 10 patients will experience \"significant chronic pain\" following a mesh repair.\\n\\nImage caption Roseanna says her children want their \"fun mum back\"\\n\\nRoseanna Clarkin, from Glasgow, is now disabled. She had to give up her job due to complications after her repair.\\n\\nShe says she was initially told by doctors the pain was \"in her head\", and wanted to end her life because \"nobody was listening\".\\n\\nIt was only after seeing the programme\\'s coverage of the mesh scandal that she discovered it had been used on her.\\n\\nAged 36, she said she was no longer able to look after her children as she had before.\\n\\n\"My kids wrote a letter saying they want their fun mum back,\" she said, breaking down in tears.\\n\\n\"My husband said he married a wife and became a carer.

Or patients may be forgetting to take their daily pill.\\n\\nIt is some of these issues that having two injections a year might help with.\\n\\nWhat do the experts say?\\n\\nProf Naveed Sattar, from the University of Glasgow, said: \"Doctors are excited by inclisiran and the potential to \\'vaccinate\\' against high cholesterol in some patients.\\n\\n\"However, many would also like to see longer term safety data from ongoing trials and to be told the cost of this new drug before they consider implications for care.\"\\n\\nProf Jacob George, from the University of Dundee, said: \"Whilst inclisiran has not yet been assessed by the European Medicines Agency or the FDA [US Food and Drug Administration], giving patients access to these innovative new medications within the safety confines of a large-scale trial is welcome news.\"\\n\\nAnd Dr Riyaz Patel, clinical lead for cardiovascular disease prevention at Barts Health NHS Trust, said: \"This as a really exciting announcement that changes the way we bring new medicines to patients earlier and [will] also propel the NHS and the UK as a world leader in this sort of clinical research.\\n\\n\"It is certainly a welcome step forwards to get exciting new drugs to patients quickly and safely.\"\\n  '},\n",

Extreme weather and melting polar ice are among the possible effects.\\n\\nWhat is climate change?\\n\\nThe Earth\\'s average temperature is about 15C but has been much higher and lower in the past.\\n\\nThere are natural fluctuations in the climate but scientists say temperatures are now rising faster than at many other times.\\n\\nThis is linked to the greenhouse effect, which describes how the Earth\\'s atmosphere traps some of the Sun\\'s energy.\\n\\nSolar energy radiating back to space from the Earth\\'s surface is absorbed by greenhouse gases and re-emitted in all directions.\\n\\nThis heats both the lower atmosphere and the surface of the planet. Without this effect, the Earth would be about 30C colder and hostile to life.\\n\\nScientists believe we are adding to the natural greenhouse effect, with gases released from industry and agriculture trapping more energy and increasing the temperature.\\n\\nThis is known as climate change or global warming.\\n\\nWhat are greenhouse gases?\\n\\nThe greenhouse gas with the greatest impact on warming is water vapour. But it remains in the atmosphere for only a few days.\\n\\nCarbon dioxide (CO2), however, persists for much longer. It would take hundreds of years for a return to pre-industrial levels and only so much can be soaked up by natural reservoirs such as the oceans.\\n\\nMost man-made emissions of CO2 come from burning fossil fuels. When carbon-absorbing forests are cut down and left to rot, or burned, that stored carbon is released, contributing to global warming.\\n\\nSince the industrial revolution began in about 1750, CO2 levels have risen more than 30%. The concentration of CO2 in the atmosphere is higher than at any time in at least 800,000 years.\\n\\nOther greenhouse gases such as methane and nitrous oxide are also released through human activities but they are less abundant than carbon dioxide.\\n\\nWhat is the evidence for warming?\\n\\nThe world is about one degree Celsius warmer than before widespread industrialisation, the World Meteorological Organization (WMO) says.\\n\\nThe 20 warmest years on record all occurred in the past 22 years, with 2015-18 making up the top four.\\n\\nAcross the globe, the average sea level increased by 3.6mm per year between 2005 and 2015.\\n\\nMost of this change was because water increases in volume as it heats up.\\n\\nHowever, melting ice is now thought to be the main reason for rising sea levels. Most glaciers in temperate regions of the world are retreating.\\n\\nAnd satellite records show a dramatic decline in Arctic sea-ice since 1979. The Greenland Ice Sheet has experienced record melting in recent years.\\n\\nSatellite data also shows the West Antarctic Ice Sheet is losing mass. A recent study indicated East Antarctica may also have started to lose mass.\\n\\nThe effects of a changing climate can also be seen in vegetation and land animals. These include earlier flowering and fruiting times for plants and changes in the territories of animals.\\n\\nHow much will temperatures rise in future?\\n\\nThe change in the global surface temperature between 1850 and the end of the 21st Century is likely to exceed 1.5C, most simulations suggest.\\n\\nThe WMO says that if the current warming trend continues, temperatures could rise 3-5C by the end of this century.\\n\\nTemperature rises of 2C had long been regarded as the gateway to dangerous warming. More recently, scientists and policymakers have argued that limiting temperature rises to 1.5C is safer.\\n\\nMedia playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Climate change: How 1.5C could change the world\\n\\nAn Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) report in 2018 suggested that keeping to the 1.5C target would require \"rapid, far-reaching and unprecedented changes in all aspects of society\".\\n\\nThe UN is leading a political effort to stabilise greenhouse-gas emissions. China emits more CO2 than any other country. It is followed by the US and the European Union member states, although emissions per person are much greater there.\\n\\nBut even if we now cut greenhouse-gas emissions dramatically, scientists say the effects will continue. Large bodies of water and ice can take hundreds of years to respond to changes in temperature. And it takes CO2 decades to be removed from the atmosphere.\\n\\nHow will climate change affect us?\\n\\nThere is uncertainty about how great the impact of a changing climate will be.\\n\\nIt could cause freshwater shortages, dramatically alter our ability to produce food, and increase the number of deaths from floods, storms and heatwaves. This is because climate change is expected to increase the frequency of extreme weather events - though linking any single event to global warming is complicated.\\n\\nMedia playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Matt McGrath explains why we should care about climate change\\n\\nAs the world warms, more water evaporates, leading to more moisture in the air. This means many areas will experience more intense rainfall - and in some places snowfall. But the risk of drought in inland areas during hot summers will increase. More flooding is expected from storms and rising sea levels. But there are likely to be very strong regional variations in these patterns.\\n\\nPoorer countries, which are least equipped to deal with rapid change, could suffer the most.\\n\\nPlant and animal extinctions are predicted as habitats change faster than species can adapt. And the World Health Organization (WHO) has warned that the health of millions could be threatened by increases in malaria, water-borne disease and malnutrition.\\n\\nMedia playback is unsupported on your device Media caption How temperatures have risen since 1884\\n\\nAs more CO2 is released into the atmosphere, uptake of the gas by the oceans increases, causing the water to become more acidic. This could pose major problems for coral reefs.\\n\\nGlobal warming will cause further changes that are likely to create further heating. This includes the release of large quantities of methane as permafrost - frozen soil found mainly at high latitudes - melts.\\n\\nResponding to climate change will be one of the biggest challenges we face this century.\\n\\nWhat questions do you have about changes in our climate?\\n\\nIn some cases your question will be published, displaying your name, age and location as you provide it, unless you state otherwise.

Does a bowl of rice produce more climate warming greenhouse gases than a plate of chips? Is wine more environmentally friendly than beer?\\n\\nTo find out the climate impact of what you eat and drink, choose from one of the 34 items in our calculator and pick how often you have it.\\n\\nHow do your food choices impact on the environment?

If you cannot view the food calculator, click to launch the interactive content.\\n\\nDesign by Prina Shah, development by Felix Stephenson and Becky Rush.\\n\\nFood production is responsible for a quarter of all greenhouse gas emissions, contributing to global warming, according to a University of Oxford study.\\n\\nHowever, the researchers found that the environmental impact of different foods varies hugely.\\n\\nTheir findings showed that meat and other animal products are responsible for more than half of food-related greenhouse gas emissions, despite providing only a fifth of the calories we eat and drink.\\n\\nOf all the products analysed in the study, beef and lamb were found to have by far the most damaging effect on the environment.\\n\\nThe findings echo recommendations on how individuals can lessen climate change by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC).\\n\\nWhen it comes to our diets, the IPCC says we need to buy less meat, milk, cheese and butter - but also eat more locally sourced seasonal food, and throw less of it away.\\n\\nThe IPCC also recommends that we insulate homes, take trains and buses instead of planes, and use video conferencing instead of business travel.\\n\\nCutting meat and dairy products from your diet could reduce an individual\\'s carbon footprint from food by two-thirds, according to the Oxford study, published in the journal Science.\\n\\nSign up for a weekly chat about climate change on Facebook Messenger\\n\\n\"What we eat is one of the most powerful drivers behind most of the world\\'s major environmental issues, whether it\\'s climate change or biodiversity loss,\" study researcher Joseph Poore told BBC News.\\n\\nChanging your diet can make a big difference to your personal environmental footprint, from saving water to reducing pollution and the loss of forests, he said.\\n\\n\"It reduces the amount of land required to produce your food by about 75% - that\\'s a huge reduction, particularly if you scale that up globally,\" Poore explained.\\n\\nIf you fly regularly, replacing flying with other forms of transport may have a bigger impact on your carbon footprint than changing your diet. A passenger\\'s carbon footprint from a one-way flight from London to New York is just under half a tonne of greenhouse gases. Switching from a regular petrol vehicle to an electric car could save more than double that over a year.\\n\\nKnowing how and where your food is produced is also important, as the same food can have huge differences in environmental impact.\\n\\nFor example, beef cattle raised on deforested land is responsible for 12 times more greenhouse gas emissions than cows reared on natural pastures.\\n\\nThe average beef from South America results in three times the amount of greenhouse gases as beef produced in Europe - and uses 10 times as much land.\\n\\nMeat and dairy are not the only foods where the choices you make can make a big difference.\\n\\nChocolate and coffee originating from deforested rainforest produce relatively high greenhouse gases.\\n\\nFor climate-friendly tomatoes, choose those grown outdoors or in high-tech greenhouses, instead of in greenhouses heated by gas or oil. Environmentally-minded beer-drinkers may be interested to know that draught beer is responsible for fewer emissions than recyclable cans, or worse, glass bottles.\\n\\nEven the most climate-friendly meat options still produce more greenhouse gases than vegetarian protein sources, like beans or nuts.\\n\\nHow did we make the calculator?\\n\\nHow is the environmental impact calculated?\\n\\nUniversity of Oxford researcher Joseph Poore, and Thomas Nemecek of the Agroecology and Environment Research Division in Zurich, Switzerland, looked at the environmental impact of 40 major food products that represent the vast majority of what is eaten globally.\\n\\nThey assessed the effect of these foods on climate-warming greenhouse gas emissions and the amount of land and fresh water used across all stages of their production, including processing, packaging, and transportation, but excluding the cooking process.\\n\\nBy analysing data from nearly 40,000 farms, 1,600 processors, packaging types and retailers, Poore and Nemecek were able to assess how different production practices and geographies have very different consequences on the planet.\\n\\nWhat about serving sizes?\\n\\nThe data in the study looked at the environmental impact for 1kg of each of the different food products.\\n\\nFor this story, these were converted to impact per serving sizes based on serving sizes from the British Dietetic Association (BDA) and healthy diet portion sizes from BUPA.\\n\\nThe figures for serving sizes based on the BDA and BUPA suggestions are often lower than portion sizes commonly found in restaurants and what people normally expect, so the figures returned by the calculator on the impact of individuals\\' consumption are likely to be higher in reality.\\n\\nProtein-rich foods were calculated using the impact per 100g of protein from Poore and Nemecek\\'s research and data on protein per serving from the BDA, to avoid differences between cooked and uncooked foods.\\n\\nWhat are greenhouse gases?\\n\\nThe figures for greenhouse gas emissions are in kilograms of carbon dioxide equivalents (CO2eq). This is a unit that converts the impact of different kinds of greenhouse gases, like methane and nitrous oxide, to the equivalent amount of carbon dioxide.\\n\\nHow do you know what my diet is equal to in miles driven?\\n\\nThe annual impact from eating a specific food is calculated by multiplying the impact of one serving of that food by the times it is eaten in a year, based on the weekly estimates submitted by the user.\\n\\nThese are then compared with the emissions of other daily habits. The European Environment Agency estimates that driving a regular petrol car produces 392g of CO2eq/mile over its entire lifecycle, including emissions from the vehicle\\'s production, fuel production and exhaust emissions per mile.\\n\\nHeating the average UK home produces 2.34 tonnes of CO2eq annually, according to data from the Committee on Climate Change, and a passenger\\'s carbon footprint for a return flight from London to Malaga is 320kg CO2eq, based on figures from the Carbon Neutral calculator.\\n\\nThe land used to produce the annual consumption of each food is compared with the size of a double tennis court, 261 metres squared.\\n\\nThe annual amount of water used is compared with a shower, based on figures suggesting the average shower lasts eight minutes and uses up 65 litres. Only \"blue water\", i.e. water taken out of rivers or the ground, is included in the data.\\n  '},\n",

in Madrid last month - were branded a disappointment by the UN Secretary-General, the British government and others.\\n\\nDecisions on key issues were put off and several countries including Australia and Brazil were accused of trying to dodge their commitments.\\n\\n\"We have to realise that this is not playing games,\" Sir David said.\\n\\n\"This is not just having a nice little debate, arguments and then coming away with a compromise.\\n\\n\"This is an urgent problem that has to be solved and, what\\'s more, we know how to do it - that\\'s the paradoxical thing, that we\\'re refusing to take steps that we know have to be taken.\"\\n\\nWhat are those steps?\\n\\nBack in 2018, the UN climate science panel spelled out how the world could have a reasonable chance of avoiding the most dangerous temperature rises in future.\\n\\nIt said that emissions of the gases heating the planet - from power stations and factories, vehicles and agriculture - should be almost halved by 2030.\\n\\nImage copyright Getty Images Image caption Australia has been badly hit by bushfires\\n\\nInstead the opposite is happening.\\n\\nThe release of those gases is still increasing rather than falling and the key gas, carbon dioxide, is now in the atmosphere at a level far above anything experienced in human history.\\n\\nAs Sir David put it: \"Every year that passes makes those steps more and more difficult to achieve.\"\\n\\nWhy does this matter right now?\\n\\nThis year is seen as a vital opportunity to turn the tide on climate change.\\n\\nThe UK is hosting what\\'s billed as a crucial UN summit, known as COP26, in Glasgow in November.\\n\\nAhead of that gathering, governments worldwide are coming under pressure to toughen their targets for cutting emissions.\\n\\nThat\\'s because their current pledges do not go nearly far enough.\\n\\nAssuming they are delivered as promised (and there\\'s no guarantee of that), there could still be a rise in the global average temperature of more than 3C by the end of the century, compared to pre-industrial levels.\\n\\nThe latest assessment by the UN\\'s Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) lays bare the dangers of that.\\n\\nIt suggests that a rise of anything above 1.5C would mean that coastal flooding, heatwaves and damage to coral reefs would become more severe.\\n\\nAnd the latest figures show that the world has already warmed by just over 1C.\\n\\nWhat happens next?\\n\\nAs things stand, further heating looks inevitable.\\n\\n\"We\\'re already living in a changed world,\" according to Professor Ed Hawkins of the University of Reading, a scientist whose depictions of global warming have often gone viral on social media.\\n\\nHe uses bold coloured stripes to show how much each year\\'s temperature is above or below average -

This brought nations together for the first time in a single agreement on tackling climate change.\\n\\nBut everyone has a carbon footprint. This is the amount of greenhouse gases like carbon dioxide - which contributes to global warming - released into the atmosphere by people\\'s actions.\\n\\nThis can be reduced in a number of ways. According to a recent report by a group of international scientists, transport is responsible for 34% of a household\\'s carbon footprint in high-income countries like the UK. The report calls for a major programme of investment in the rail and bus network, with lower ticket prices and investment in safer cycling.\\n\\nHome heating presents another challenge and opportunity. It is responsible for 21% of a household\\'s carbon footprint.\\n\\nThis could be cut by turning down the thermostat, having better-insulated houses and changing to low-carbon heating systems.\\n\\nIs the fundamental problem human overpopulation? - David Bassett, Locks Heath, Hants\\n\\nAccording to the United Nations, the current world population is about 7.7 billion and could reach 9.7 billion in 2050.\\n\\nThis population growth drives higher demand for food, greater energy consumption and more competition for resources. And it increases the production of the gases that cause global warming.\\n\\nImage copyright Getty Images\\n\\nAnd a recent major study, by a global group of 11,000 scientists, concluded that the world needs to stabilise its population.\\n\\nThe study has attracted quite a deal of controversy, but its authors say such action is needed if the world is to avoid what they call \"a catastrophic threat\" from climate change.\\n\\nIs a plant-based diet one of the best steps you can take? - Sophie Hill, Astwood Bank, Worcs\\n\\nIt is estimated that 26% of global emissions come from food and more than half of this from animal products.\\n\\nThis is because producing food from animals uses more resources than food from plants. Cows and sheep also produce methane - a greenhouse gas.\\n\\nAccording to a 2019 report by UN experts, switching to a plant-based diet can help fight climate change.\\n\\nThey said that more people could be fed using less land if individuals cut down on eating meat. But they stopped short of advising people to become vegan or vegetarian.\\n\\nAnd a University of Oxford study found that if everybody on Earth cut meat and dairy from their diet, there could be a 49% reduction in greenhouse gas emissions from food production.\\n\\nWhat can we do about other, bigger countries not adopting green practices? - Christina Dudley, Beenham, Berks\\n\\nChina and the US are the world\\'s largest emitters of CO2, responsible for 16 megatonnes between them a year.\\n\\nIn terms of emissions per head of population, the picture is different. The US is still near the top, with 15.53 tonnes. But the UK (5.99 tonnes) is only slightly behind China (6.59 tonnes).\\n\\nSo what can a smaller country, like the UK, do to exert pressure for change?\\n\\nOn an individual level, consumers could decide to seek out \"green\" products and boycott ones from more polluting parts of the world, says Alyssa Gilbert, climate policy director at Imperial College London.\\n\\nThere is also an opportunity for the UK to come up with innovative ideas that larger countries might adopt, Ms Gilbert suggests.\\n\\n\"As a country we are small and nimble, so we can pilot ideas around technology and policy in the hope that we can export them to other countries\", she says.\\n\\nAt government level, the UK can also use diplomacy, as well as international aid, to bring about change.\\n\\nWhy are we not capturing and using the greenhouse gases already in our atmosphere? - Jonathan Miller, Cornwall\\n\\nCarbon capture, to remove and store greenhouse gases, already happens naturally. All plants and trees take carbon dioxide from the atmosphere and groundwater.\\n\\nSo, planting trees is seen as an important weapon in the fight against global warming.\\n\\nThe UK\\'s Committee on Climate Change (CCC) says significant rises in tree planting \"need to happen quickly\" if other targets to cut carbon are not met.\\n\\nIt says 30,000 hectares of woodland should be planted annually, more than double the new trees planted in 2018.\\n\\nThe UK government says it is committed to planting 11 million trees by 2022.\\n\\nIn February 2019, the Drax power station in North Yorkshire, became the first in Europe to capture carbon dioxide (CO2) from wood-burning.\\n\\nAnother approach, currently being offered by a company in Switzerland, is to pull carbon dioxide directly from the air. This gas can then be sold for other purposes, like being used to grow vegetables in hi-tech greenhouses.\\n\\nBut schemes like these are, as yet, relatively few and small-scale.\\n\\nWhat questions do you have about changes in our climate and about the Our Planet Matters series?\\n\\nIn some cases your question will be published, displaying your name, age and location as you provide it, unless you state otherwise.

And we can use their shells to figure out the chemistry of the ocean and its temperature, so we can study in great detail the environmental changes that are occurring in the run-up to the extinction event.\\n\\n\"And what we discovered is that the only way in which we can get our (climate) model simulations to match the observed temperature changes is to have the volcanic emissions of harmful gases done and dusted a couple of hundred thousand years before the impact event.\\n\\n\"We find the impact event is exactly contemporaneous with the extinction.\"\\n\\nInvestigations of a 200km-wide crater under the Gulf of Mexico suggest it is the scar left by the culprit asteroid.\\n\\nWhen it hit the Earth, the city-sized object would immediately have generated tsunami and wide-scale fires - in addition to hurling billions of tonnes of debris in all directions.\\n\\nBut what scientists have also established recently is that the asteroid struck rocks rich in sulphur. When this material was vaporised and ejected into the high atmosphere, it would have led to a rapid and deep cooling of the climate (albeit over a relatively short period), making life a struggle for all sorts of plant and animal life.\\n\\nAs the fossil record shows, the dinosaurs, apart from birds, couldn\\'t get beyond the stressful environmental changes. In contrast, the mammals could and rose to the prominence they enjoy today.\\n\\nThe new study is published in the journal Science.

              "  'text': '\\n   Image copyright Getty Images\\n\\nFor more than two decades after his asylum application was rejected, Sunny found a safe haven aboard the buses that zigzag across London at night. What\\'s it like to spend every night on the lower decks?\\n\\nSunny waits patiently, wind penetrating his well-worn jacket and the winter cold biting at his extremities.\\n\\nIt\\'s past midnight and his legs are weary but he stands firm and smiles as the bus lunges to a halt, its wing mirror clipping overgrown branches on its way. He moves aside to let other passengers board, greets the familiar face of the driver with a gentle bow of the head and taps his weathered Oyster card on the payment point.\\n\\nRelieved at finding his favoured spot at the back of the lower deck empty, he slides into place and gets comfortable for the long ride ahead. Sunny hugs his bag to his stomach, feels his wrinkled hands start to thaw, and closes his eyes.\\n\\nImage copyright Venetia Menzies Image caption Sunny\\'s travel card holder quotes Jesus: \"Peace I bequeath to you, My own peace I give you, A peace the world cannot give.\"\\n\\nLeaving behind the smell of fried chicken and noise of London\\'s late-night traffic, his mind drifts.\\n\\nHe sees his younger self, kneeling in prayer between the concrete walls of a Nigerian prison, waiting to be executed. His offence: struggling for democracy.\\n\\nA guard barges into the cell, lifts him to his feet and rushes him down silent corridors, out into blinding sunlight, where a car is waiting.\\n\\nFamily and friends have bought his freedom, paying off everyone from the prison officials to the air hostess on the flight to London.\\n\\nSunny is jerked back to the present as a scrum of drunken men, singing tunelessly, trail through the doors and up to the top deck. It must be three or four in the morning, he calculates - the usual hour for trouble.\\n\\nAround this time, Sunny often notices three distinct groups around him. It\\'s a neat survey of modern London. There are those who came to this country for a better life, rushing to their pre-dawn cleaning jobs. Another group - mostly indigenous Britons - heads home from the nightclubs, talking loudly and cramming down fast food. And finally there are the homeless, those who have nowhere else to go, for whom buses are a place to rest.\\n\\nSunny doesn\\'t resent the others; he has learned to enjoy their boisterousness. When they smile, he smiles. When they laugh, he laughs too. It\\'s amazing how a few pints can evaporate class boundaries, stripping reserved Englishmen of their inhibitions so they chat with the homeless as temporary equals.\\n\\nSunny tries to recall the last time he felt as happy as these drunken men.\\n\\nImage copyright Venetia Menzies Image caption Sunny is telling his story as part of a documentary photography project\\n\\nPerhaps it was when his asylum claim was still under review. Back then he was full of gratitude for his second chance at life. He took a course in documentary-making, choosing to report on the lives of London\\'s homeless, never imagining he would soon be in their shoes.\\n\\nSunny had dared to hope for a bright future, safe under the protection of Her Majesty the Queen - that figurehead familiar from sun-faded colonial posters across Nigeria. But his request for asylum was refused.\\n\\nThat left him with two options: go home to a country under the iron fist of a military ruler, where his death sentence would finally be carried out, or go underground.\\n\\nIt wasn\\'t a difficult choice.\\n\\nAnd so began 21 years as a nomad on London\\'s buses, which Sunny quickly realised were safer and warmer than the streets.\\n\\nIt was a church minister, a woman of unwavering generosity, who first bought him a monthly pass to save him multiple nightly fares. She continued to do so, month after month, and other friends would chip in if she wasn\\'t around.\\n\\nBy day Sunny would volunteer at churches - he would attend several during his time in London. When his work was done, he would often head to Westminster Reference Library where he could catch up on the day\\'s news or pick up where he\\'d left off in the book he\\'d been reading.\\n\\nHe might then ask a restaurant manager if they could spare some food, and says he was rarely turned away.\\n\\nImage copyright Sunny Image caption Sunny\\'s photographs provide a homeless person\\'s perspective on the world\\n\\nBut no later than 9pm he would invariably be stepping aboard a bus for the first of three, maybe four, nightly trips across the capital.\\n\\nHe soon discovered the best buses for a good rest. There was the trusty N29, from Trafalgar Square to the northern suburb of Wood Green. But the 25 - which ran 24 hours - offered the longest uninterrupted sleep. In traffic, it would take two hours to get from central London to Ilford, in Essex, where - if he was really lucky - a driver might take pity and leave him sleeping on board at the terminus.\\n\\nMore often, the homeless passengers - maybe four or five of them - would be woken and turfed off until the next driver arrived.\\n\\nMost were destitute women, British or African, who used the bus as a sanctuary from the threat of sexual assault. Laden with bags, they would be grateful for Sunny\\'s help lugging them on and off the bus.\\n\\nImage copyright Venetia Menzies\\n\\nSunny always travelled light. A small tote bag allowed him to avoid the stigma of homelessness during daylight hours.\\n\\nSome homeless folk would stretch out across seats but he preferred not to inconvenience other riders.\\n\\nIt took a while to learn all the tricks. At first he hadn\\'t worried about where to sit. But then he found himself in a confrontation with two men who had been trying to set light to the hair of an unsuspecting woman in front. He chased them off but resolved to avoid conflict where possible.\\n\\nThe lower deck, he concluded, was the preserve of reasonable people, of families and the elderly. Trouble rarely erupted so close to the driver. The back seats were optimal, not just for the head rest but for peace of mind.\\n\\nImage copyright Sunny\\n\\nBut there were always distractions: the lurching bus, the neon lights, the noisy night-riders and the humming engine. Two hours of proper sleep across an entire night was an achievement.\\n\\nAt dawn - or when he got hungry, whichever came first - he would head to a McDonald\\'s.\\n\\nHe never begged but friendly staff at the Leicester Square branch would give him food and let him shave in the bathrooms. Fellow customers could be kind, too.\\n\\nOr, if he timed it right, he could hop off at the 24-hour branch in Haringey - halfway along the N29 route. There, he could enjoy a peace that was rare in the central London branches, rest his head on a table and continue his slumber.\\n\\nFor a handful of Christmases, Sunny broke his routine and tried winter night shelters provided by churches.\\n\\nImage copyright Getty Images\\n\\nSeven different churches worked a rota. But they were scattered in different locations across the capital, creating a daily exodus of people - the \"walking dead\", in his words - trying to reach their next bed before the evening curfew.\\n\\nSunny came to realise he preferred the bus to lying on stone floors, packed shoulder-to-shoulder. It was hard to sleep through the smell of tobacco, alcohol and unwashed bodies. And, of course, the screams of the others as they lay there tormented by nightmares.\\n\\nFrom the seats of London buses, Sunny watched the changing face of the capital. Slowly, the white population declined as a proportion of the total. The ranks of the homeless expanded.\\n\\nIn this most diverse of spaces, he became adept at matching faces or dialects to places of origin. And he developed a sixth sense for trouble, detecting warning signs in gestures: the smirk of trouble-making teens, the pursed lips of an explosive racist.\\n\\nThere were combinations that could result in confrontation: drunken football fans and a veiled woman; tired commuters and people using speakerphone; gang members and their local rivals. In the months following the Brexit referendum of 2016, hostility to migrants seemed to become more commonplace. \"Go back home,\" became a regular refrain.\\n\\nImage copyright Venetia Menzies\\n\\nSunny didn\\'t blame the British government for his predicament. Had his own country\\'s not been so bad, he wouldn\\'t have been here in the first place.\\n\\nEventually, the refugee centre at Notre Dame de France church, off Leicester Square, made an application for leave to remain on his behalf. If people prove they have continuously lived in the UK for 20 years, they can qualify to settle. But Sunny had spent that time avoiding all records, evading detection. How could he demonstrate he had been there all this time?\\n\\n\"I understand that your client is currently homeless, but we still require documentary evidence to show continuous residence from 1995 to the present date,\" said a letter from the Home Office. \"Evidence such as utility bills, bank statements, tenancy agreements…\"\\n\\nSunny asked the friendliest bus drivers to write him a letter of support. One obliged, confirming he was \"a regular rider throughout the night\".\\n\\nThe churches he had volunteered at over the years provided supporting statements and dug out old photographs recording his presence at charity events.\\n\\nThese days Sunny is the one taking pictures. He reaches inside his bag for the disposable camera he\\'s been given to tell his story as part of a photography project.\\n\\nThere are a few frames left. Lifting the viewfinder to his eye, Sunny pushes firm against the flash button and pauses to adjust his composition. Click… He releases the shutter.\\n\\nThe photograph will not simply show rows of mostly empty seats on the lower deck of a bus. It will be a picture of life as a free man.\\n\\nImage copyright Sunny\\n\\nAt the age of 55, in 2017, Sunny was granted leave to remain. It had taken a year but finally he had the right to shelter, to work, to exist. And he was thankful.\\n\\nIt is almost his stop, deep in south London\\'s suburbs - he still isn\\'t used to travelling to a destination. Even now he sometimes sleeps on buses, though more often during the day rather than at night. For so long a sanctuary, they remain a place to empty his mind - their familiarity a comfort.\\n\\nSunny\\'s knees click as he hoists himself up. He\\'s getting older, his struggle has aged him beyond his years. He thanks the driver and carefully steps down to the pavement. Leaning into the breeze, he walks towards his bedsit, smiling as the cold cracks his lips.\\n\\nSunny, whose name has been changed, collaborated with photographer and journalist Venetia Menzies to document his story for one year.

              "  'text': '\\n   About 100 million animals are killed for meat in the UK every month - but very little is heard about the people doing the killing. Here, one former abattoir worker describes her job, and the effect it had on her mental health.\\n\\nWarning: Some readers may find this story disturbing\\n\\nWhen I was a child I dreamed of becoming a vet. I imagined myself playing with mischievous puppies, calming down frightened kittens, and - as I was a countryside kid - performing check-ups on the local farm animals if they felt under the weather.\\n\\nIt was a pretty idyllic life that I dreamt up for myself - but it\\'s not quite how things worked out. Instead, I ended up working in a slaughterhouse.\\n\\nI was there for six years and, far from spending my days making poorly cows feel better, I was in charge of ensuring about 250 of them were killed every day.\\n\\nWhether they eat meat or not, most people in the UK have never been inside an abattoir - and for good reason. They are filthy, dirty places. There\\'s animal faeces on the floor, you see and smell the guts, and the walls are covered in blood.\\n\\nAnd the smell... It hits you like a wall when you first enter, and then hangs thick in the air around you. The odour of dying animals surrounds you like a vapour.\\n\\nWhy would anybody choose to visit, let alone work in a place like this?\\n\\nFor me, it was because I\\'d already spent a couple of decades working in the food industry - in ready-meal factories and the like. So when I got an offer from an abattoir to be a quality control manager, working directly with the slaughtermen, it felt like a fairly innocuous job move. I was in my 40s at the time.\\n\\nOn my first day, they gave me a tour of the premises, explained how everything worked and, most importantly, asked me pointedly and repeatedly if I was OK. It was quite common for people to faint during the tour, they explained, and the physical safety of visitors and new starters was very important to them. I was OK, I think. I felt sick, but I thought I\\'d get used to it.\\n\\nSoon, though, I realised there was no point pretending that it was just another job. I\\'m sure not all abattoirs are the same but mine was a brutal, dangerous place to work. There were countless occasions when, despite following all of the procedures for stunning, slaughterers would get kicked by a massive, spasming cow as they hoisted it up to the machine for slaughter. Similarly, cows being brought in would get scared and panic, which was pretty terrifying for all of us too. You\\'ll know if you\\'ve ever stood next to one that they are huge animals.\\n\\nPersonally, I didn\\'t suffer physical injuries, but the place affected my mind.\\n\\nAs I spent day after day in that large, windowless box, my chest felt increasingly heavy and a grey fog descended over me. At night, my mind would taunt me with nightmares, replaying some of the horrors I\\'d witnessed throughout the day.\\n\\nOne skill that you master while working at an abattoir is disassociation. You learn to become numb to death and to suffering. Instead of thinking about cows as entire beings, you separate them into their saleable, edible body parts. It doesn\\'t just make the job easier - it\\'s necessary for survival.\\n\\nThere are things, though, that have the power to shatter the numbness. For me, it was the heads.\\n\\nAt the end of the slaughter line there was a huge skip, and it was filled with hundreds of cows\\' heads. Each one of them had been flayed, with all of the saleable flesh removed. But one thing was still attached - their eyeballs.\\n\\nWhenever I walked past that skip, I couldn\\'t help but feel like I had hundreds of pairs of eyes watching me. Some of them were accusing, knowing that I\\'d participated in their deaths. Others seemed to be pleading, as if there were some way I could go back in time and save them. It was disgusting, terrifying and heart-breaking, all at the same time. It made me feel guilty. The first time I saw those heads, it took all of my strength not to vomit.\\n\\nI know things like this bothered the other workers, too. I\\'ll never forget the day, after I\\'d been at the abattoir for a few months, when one of the lads cut into a freshly killed cow to gut her - and out fell the foetus of a calf. She was pregnant. He immediately started shouting and throwing his arms about.\\n\\nI took him into a meeting room to calm him down - and all he could say was, \"It\\'s just not right, it\\'s not right,\" over and over again. These were hard men, and they rarely showed any emotion. But I could see tears prickling his eyes.\\n\\nEven worse than pregnant cows, though, were the young calves we sometimes had to kill.\\n\\nA physically demanding role\\n\\nOn its website, the British Meat Processors Association (BMPA) says the UK meat industry has some of the highest standards of hygiene and welfare in the world.\\n\\nMany of its members, it says, \"are at the forefront of abattoir design with facilities designed to house the animals and help them move around the site with ease and without any pain, distress or suffering\".\\n\\nMeat processing in the UK employs about 75,000 people of whom approximately 69% are from other European Union member states, the BMPA notes.\\n\\n\"The barrier to British people taking up roles in meat processing is an unwillingness to work in what is perceived to be a challenging environment,\" it says. \"Most people, while they eat meat, find it difficult to work in its production partly because of the obvious aversion to the slaughter process but also because it is a physically demanding role.\"\\n\\nAt the height of the BSE and bovine tuberculosis crises in the 1990s, whole herds of animals had to be slaughtered. I worked at the slaughterhouse after 2010, so well after the BSE crisis, but if an animal tested positive for TB or BSE they would still bring the entire herd in to be culled - bulls, heifers and calves. I remember one day in particular, when I\\'d been there for about a year or so, when we had to slaughter five calves at the same time.\\n\\nWe tried to keep them within the rails of the pens, but they were so small and bony that they could easily skip out and trot around, slightly wobbly on their newly born legs. They sniffed us, like puppies, because they were young and curious. Some of the boys and I stroked them, and they suckled our fingers.\\n\\nWhen the time came to kill them, it was tough, both emotionally and physically. Slaughterhouses are designed for slaughtering really large animals, so the stun boxes are normally just about the right size to hold a cow that weighs about a tonne. When we put the first calf in, it only came about a quarter of a way up the box, if that. We put all five calves in at once. Then we killed them.\\n\\nAfterwards, looking at the dead animals on the ground, the slaughterers were visibly upset.\\n\\nI rarely saw them so vulnerable. Emotions in the abattoir tended to be bottled up. Nobody talked about their feelings; there was an overwhelming sense that you weren\\'t allowed to show weakness. Plus, there were a lot of workers who wouldn\\'t have been able to talk about their feelings to the rest of us even if they\\'d wanted to. Many were migrant workers, predominantly from Eastern Europe, whose English wasn\\'t good enough for them to seek help if they were struggling.\\n\\nA lot of the men I was working with were also moonlighting elsewhere - they\\'d finish their 10 or 11 hours at the abattoir before going on to another job - and exhaustion often took its toll. Some developed alcohol problems, often coming into work smelling strongly of drink. Others became addicted to energy drinks, and more than one had a heart attack. These drinks were then removed from the abattoir vending machines, but people would still bring them in from home and drink them secretly in their cars.\\n\\n\\'I\\'m an animal lover\\'\\n\\nA slaughterman at Tideford abbattoir, described his approach to his work, for The Food Chain on the BBC World Service:\\n\\n\"Basically, I\\'m an animal lover. I don\\'t take any pleasure in what we\\'re doing, but if I can do it as quietly and professionally as possible, then I think we\\'ve achieved something. Just be professional, do it, then switch off - and then, when we\\'ve finished work, go home and be a normal person. It\\'s not for everybody. I know a couple of butchers that would not walk inside this abattoir; the thought of taking something\\'s life, they find that difficult to accept, or witness.\"\\n\\nListen to The Food Chain: Inside the Abbattoir\\n\\nAbattoir work has been linked to multiple mental health problems - one researcher uses the term \"Perpetrator-Induced Traumatic Syndrome\" to refer to symptoms of PTSD suffered by slaughterhouse workers. I personally suffered from depression, a condition exacerbated by the long hours, the relentless work, and being surrounded by death. After a while, I started feeling suicidal.\\n\\nIt\\'s unclear whether slaughterhouse work causes these problems, or whether the job attracts people with pre-existing conditions. But either way, it\\'s an incredibly isolating job, and it\\'s hard to seek help. When I\\'d tell people what I did for work, I\\'d either be met with absolute revulsion, or a curious, jokey fascination. Either way, I could never open up to people about the effect it was having on me. Instead I sometimes joked along with them, telling gory tales about skinning a cow or handling its innards. But mostly I just kept quiet.\\n\\nA few years into my time at the abattoir, a colleague started making flippant comments about \"not being here in six months\". Everyone would laugh it off. He was a bit of a joker, so people assumed he was taking the mick, saying he\\'d have a new job or something. But it made me feel really uneasy. I took him into a side room and asked him what he meant, and he broke down. He admitted that he was plagued by suicidal thoughts, that he didn\\'t feel like he could cope any more, and that he needed help - but he begged me not to tell our bosses.\\n\\nI was able to help him get treatment from his GP - and in helping him, I realised I needed to help myself too. I felt like the horrific things I was seeing had clouded my thinking, and I was in a full-blown state of depression. It felt like a big step, but I needed to get out of there.\\n\\nAfter I left my job at the abattoir, things started looking brighter. I changed tack completely and began working with mental health charities, encouraging people to open up about their feelings and seek professional help - even if they don\\'t think they need it, or feel like they don\\'t deserve it.\\n\\nA few months after leaving, I heard from one of my former colleagues. He told me that a man who\\'d worked with us, whose job was to flay the carcasses, had killed himself.\\n\\nSometimes I recall my days at the slaughterhouse. I think about my former colleagues working relentlessly, as though they were treading water in a vast ocean, with dry land completely out of sight. I remember my colleagues who didn\\'t survive.\\n\\nAnd at night, when I close my eyes and try to sleep, I still sometimes see hundreds of pairs of eyeballs staring back at me.\\n\\nAs told to Ashitha Nagesh\\n\\nIllustrations by Katie Horwich\\n\\nYou may also be interested in:\\n\\nTwenty million chickens are killed each week to feed consumers in the UK.

The experience has left him thinking hard about what can be done to prevent this happening again, reports the BBC\\'s Sue Mitchell.\\n\\nWhen Peter Trimingham volunteered to become a flood warden in the village where he\\'s lived since childhood, he hadn\\'t imagined it would lead to the toughest challenge of his life.\\n\\nHe and his four fellow flood wardens, all over 60, started hastily bagging sand on the night of 8 November, but quickly ran out.

Both burst their banks into an area of drained fenland that was already sodden from rain over a period of weeks.\\n\\n\"I\\'ve been studying the history of the area and was talking to community groups down the river Don and various people were saying, \\'Well my grandad used to have a boat and we didn\\'t know why,\\'\" he says.\\n\\n\"All the way from Sheffield right down to Doncaster, the communities had boats because they knew they got flooded five, six times a year, and you just had the boat. Like the guys with the barrels of beer, you were prepared. But then from the 1950s, we\\'ve engineered the solutions and people then forget that they ever needed that, and [now they say], \\'Oh yeah, we thought my grandad was bonkers, but aha, that explains it!\"\\n\\nImage copyright Fishlake History Society Image caption Percy Smith the postman in the flood of 1932, with David Duckitt\\n\\nPeter Trimingham and the other flood wardens accept that a degree of complacency had crept in but believe that some of the problems in Fishlake have their roots in flood defence systems introduced a decade ago in Sheffield. In 2007, floods in the city led to two deaths and hundreds of evacuations. After that, £20m was spent on a flood-defence scheme in the Don Valley near the city, which Ian Rotherham agrees contributed to Fishlake\\'s problems.\\n\\n\"In Sheffield, the main factories and other areas affected in 2007 are now protected. However, if you are keeping the water out there, then you are moving it faster downstream, and Fishlake bore the brunt of this. You\\'re not holding the water in the upper catchment - defending those businesses and premises means you\\'re moving the water downstream faster. It\\'s going to hit sooner, harder and deeper.\"\\n\\nPeter and the other flood wardens were powerless when this water poured in, flooding more than half of the 250 homes in the village.\\n\\nPeople were working in the dark with freezing cold water pouring through every crack and hole and rising quickly.\\n\\n\"It\\'s pretty traumatic. You\\'ve not got vision; you\\'ve got darkness and floodwater - two very, very dangerous combinations,\" Peter says.\\n\\n\"You have no concept of time. You can\\'t see and my phone was destroyed in the flood water anyway. You feel so small and insignificant and useless: something much more powerful than you can\\'t be imagined unless you\\'ve been in it.\"\\n\\nFind out more\\n\\nFor many in Fishlake the loss can\\'t be quantified: it includes everything from photos, treasured possessions and mementos to cars and furniture.\\n\\nThe community came together in the immediate aftermath of the disaster. Farmers used their tractors to help get people to safety. One, Greg Mawson, describes how he battled to save others, only to return to find his farmyard under up to eight feet of water and thousands of tonnes of straw lost.\\n\\nThe local church, St Cuthbert\\'s, provided space for people to sleep on the night of the floods and has acted as a storage hub for hundreds of donations of food, clothing, children\\'s toys and cleaning products, from mops to vats of disinfectant.\\n\\nImage copyright Getty Images\\n\\nBut people are getting back to normal at different speeds. Some of those who were evacuated are still unable to return. Many homes hum and drone with heaters, dehumidifiers and fans.\\n\\nThose whose home insurance doesn\\'t cover flood insurance, or who have yet to receive insurance payouts, have received two recovery grants of about £700 in total from Doncaster Council and a local charity, South Yorkshire Community Foundation. According to Peter Trimingham, the response from insurers has been mixed; some people have been paid quickly and have been able to get on with rebuilding, while others have been left arguing about what is covered and what needs to be done.\\n\\n\"It\\'s incredibly stressful because you go from coming downstairs to a flooded house - or worse, you\\'re in a flooded bungalow and left with just the clothes you\\'re stood in. Some people have to wait because the insurance companies are slow - that means you don\\'t get the house cleared, you don\\'t get the dehumidifiers in,\" he says.\\n\\n\"That\\'s the experience people are going through now. So a natural disaster is followed by a human disaster and that is the point where people are really, really low.\"\\n\\nImage copyright Getty Images Image caption Fishlake, still partially submerged on 12 November\\n\\nIt was Day 21 before Peter\\'s home was fully equipped with dehumidifiers, beginning a process that took weeks. He, his wife Fiona, and their son, Paddy, have just started sleeping there again but the downstairs is a wreck - all the soft furnishings had to go in the skip - and it\\'s not clear when they\\'ll get the final go-ahead from insurers to begin rebuilding.\\n\\nThis feeling of helplessness is leading residents to demand more input in designing solutions. They don\\'t want to see a situation in which Fishlake is safeguarded at the expense of other communities.\\n\\n\"I think we\\'re reactive to flooding and given what\\'s happening we need to become more proactive,\" says Alison Slack, from Fishlake Cricket Club.\\n\\n\"Putting in a flood defences only means you\\'re going to move a problem somewhere else and I seriously would not want anybody going through what the village has gone through.\"\\n\\nImage caption Chief flood warden and parish council chairman, John Waite, checking on the pumps used to reduce flood levels\\n\\nOne scheme that has caught Peter Trimingham\\'s eye is being piloted in Hull and overseen by Dr Liz Sharp, from the University of Sheffield. It involves rainwater harvesting using water butts in flood areas.\\n\\n\"The project is just finishing now and so far we\\'ve just looked at which people will be willing to take water butts for this purpose and a few simple calculations on what impact it would have,\" says Dr Sharp.\\n\\n\"What we also found is that quite a few of the people we talked to actually said, \\'Well, if they were to text us and tell us when to empty our water out, we would empty it to create more capacity.\\' And people were really willing to do that because they know that they\\'re vulnerable to flooding. They know it\\'s a horrible experience and they want to help other people and prevent that problem.\"\\n\\nImage copyright Getty Images\\n\\nThe element of community engagement in this scheme strongly appeals to Peter Trimingham.\\n\\n\"It\\'s this feeling that you\\'re doing something and that you\\'re contributing to the public good as well as your own good. We just need more ideas like that, that are so simple and that have so much impact for so little cost,\" he says.\\n\\n\"People can feel they\\'re actually doing something as opposed to the way that we felt in Fishlake. We were flooded and we felt lacking in power. This empowers ordinary people to do something brilliant.\"\\n\\nAnother scheme he\\'s interested in has taken root in Sheffield, and unlike earlier flood defence measures it could actually slow down the speed at which run-off enters the Don and bears down on Fishlake. It\\'s a project to transform semi-redundant roads into a network of flower meadows and wetlands, and also footpaths to increase access to the riverside district.\\n\\nAt Porter Brook, in the heart of the city, river plants are now blooming in a small section of the waterway, where a \"pocket park\" has been created.\\n\\nImage copyright Zac Tudor / Sheffield City Council\\n\\n\"In the event of the floods this space will hold the water,\" says Ian Rotherham. He pays tribute to \"enlightened\" city council planners and developers.\\n\\n\"It\\'s created a gorgeous little spot. You can come here in spring, you can hear birds singing, you will see kingfishers, we have got trout back in the river. We\\'ve got salmon spawning this year, in the upper reaches of the River Don. That\\'s brilliant.\"\\n\\nThese projects give Peter Trimingham hope that something good can come out of what\\'s happened to his community. He wants more coherent government planning on water management, rather than a series of reactions to individual crises.\\n\\n\"It\\'s got to start in Westminster. We make decisions about planning, we make decisions about water, and we\\'ve got to stop treating it as the enemy that comes over the bank,\" he says.\\n\\n\"It needs to be the friend and we need to look after it.\"\\n\\nYou may also be interested in:\\n\\nThe northernmost Orkney island, North Ronaldsay, is home to just 50 people and 2,000 sheep.

It\\'s said to bring spiritual enlightenment and to help with addiction, depression and trauma. But a string of allegations suggests there\\'s a darker side to the ayahuasca scene.\\n\\nWarning: this article contains details of alleged sexual assaults\\n\\nRebekah first tried ayahuasca on a \"complete whim\" when she was travelling in Peru in 2015.\\n\\n\"I thought it sounded interesting and I thought I might as well give it a try,\" says Rebekah, a New Zealander in her 20s who asked the BBC not to use her surname. \"So I found a retreat centre that I felt was good and I just went for it and it was amazing.\"\\n\\nAyahuasca can induce visions of things like serpents, palaces, and alien beings - and bring up long-forgotten memories. Like many who\\'ve drunk the brew, Rebekah has a wide-eyed distant look as she reminisces about the experience.\\n\\n\"It was like being guided very gently and very kindly through some really awful experiences that I\\'d had in the past,\" Rebekah says. \"And returning back home after that, I felt like my relationships were a lot stronger. I felt it was a lot easier to share and receive love.\\n\\n\"They do say that ayahuasca is like 20 years of psychotherapy. And I completely believe that.\"\\n\\nImage copyright Alamy Image caption Ayahuasca and chakruna leaves being cooked ahead of a ceremony in Peru\\n\\nAyahuasca is usually taken in ceremonies at night, led by a healer - sometimes called a shaman. He or she will drink the sticky brown liquid - a brew of two Amazonian plants - then dole out helpings to the participants.\\n\\nIt\\'s been used by tribes in the Amazon region for centuries but now there\\'s a boom in what\\'s become known as \"ayahuasca tourism\", with ever more specialist retreat centres opening. Travellers often come for help dealing with mental health problems - and a growing body of scientific research suggests ayahuasca could be an effective treatment.\\n\\nAbout half an hour or so into a ceremony, the medicine takes its effect and the healer will start singing sacred chants, known as icaros, which guide the participants through their visions. Drinkers usually \"purge\" during ceremonies too, vomiting and sometimes getting diarrhoea as well.\\n\\nWhen Rebekah went on her first ayahuasca retreat, she was the only single woman there and noticed that the male healer was paying her special attention.\\n\\n\"How he treated me was very different, which I didn\\'t find suspicious at the time. But upon reflection, now I do.\"\\n\\nA year later, by now a more experienced ayahuasca drinker, Rebekah returned to the same retreat in Peru. The same healer was leading the ceremonies.\\n\\nOnce again, she says, she was treated differently from everyone else. There was a lot of flattery. Then the healer began confiding in Rebekah.\\n\\n\"He constantly told me that he had a lot of troubles,\" she says, \"and he said he was having problems with his wife, that he wasn\\'t sexually fulfilled, and that I was the one who was able to cure him of that.\"\\n\\nRebekah was 20 at the time; the healer in his 50s.\\n\\n\"He also promised me a lot of spiritual advancement or a lot of spiritual power, if we had a relationship - while his wife was down the road.\"\\n\\nFind out more\\n\\nSimon Maybin and Josephine Casserly\\'s documentary Ayahuasca: Fear and Healing in the Amazon on is broadcast on BBC Radio 4\\'s Crossing Continents on 16 January 2020 at 11:00\\n\\nOr listen again on BBC Sounds\\n\\nRebekah says the healer sexually abused her, coercing her into sexual acts.\\n\\n\"It\\'s disgusting,\" she says. \"Because he was a shaman, I thought he had moral superiority in a sense and I trusted him.\"\\n\\nAfter she was abused, Rebekah left the centre - and the country: \"I booked a flight and got the hell out of there.\"\\n\\nShe was left with a tangle of painful emotions: \"Disgust, repulsion, betrayal - confusion, as well as to why a guide would do this, why a teacher would do this and why they would exploit their power like that.\"\\n\\nRebekah\\'s alleged abuser is still the head shaman at his centre - which gets five-star ratings on review sites.\\n\\n\"He is still there,\" Rebekah says, clearly deeply angered by the situation. Her hands are visibly shaking. \"There are other centres that I know of as well that are still operating. There\\'ve been multiple women that have been sexually abused in these centres.\"\\n\\nExperiences of sexual abuse seem to be widespread in this world. We\\'ve heard numerous allegations against numerous healers and read many testimonies of sexual abuse on online forums.\\n\\nOne name that comes up repeatedly is Guillermo Arévalo, a well-known healer who\\'s been honoured by the Peruvian Congress for his work on sustainable development.\\n\\n\"He came to Canada many times,\" says a woman in her 40s whom we\\'re calling Anna.\\n\\n\"It was quite lucrative - big ceremonies. They\\'d fill up fast, people paying C$300 (£175) to come and sit with Guillermo. He had kind of a status. It was an honour to sit in ceremony with him.\"\\n\\nImage copyright Getty Images\\n\\nAnna, who had long been interested in alternative medicine, hoped ayahuasca might help her deal with her addiction to heroin.\\n\\nAt first, she was impressed by Arévalo.\\n\\n\"Like a lot of people, you\\'re flabbergasted by the man\\'s presence and power and ability to lead the ceremony - it\\'s quite profound,\" she says. \"The chanting. He is a good healer.\"\\n\\nBut a ceremony about seven years ago dramatically changed Anna\\'s opinion.\\n\\n\"It was completely pitch black, the room had no windows. There were a lot of people.\\n\\n\"I was under the effects of the medicine. When you\\'re under the effects there\\'s lots of different sounds. People are crying, verbalising things that make no sense at all, purging or moaning.\\n\\n\"Even if I had been able to say something, nobody would respond.\"\\n\\nImage copyright Getty Images\\n\\nAnna was having a difficult time. She recalls lying down, moaning and groaning. \"Guillermo came and he sat with me and at first it was a sense of relief because I think I\\'m going to get some help,\" she says.\\n\\n\"He started to chant to me and put his hands on my stomach over my clothing which is normal. And then he put his hands down my pants. And there\\'s this sense of feeling frozen. I lay there in fear and then he put his hands up my shirt and felt around my breasts.\"\\n\\nShe remembers thinking: \"\\'What the heck was that all about?\\' Just a sense of disbelief and confusion.\"\\n\\nIt\\'s taken six years for Anna to feel able to speak out about what happened to her.\\n\\n\"Women are conditioned to accept this behaviour. For myself, coming from a history of addiction - and I\\'ve had abusive relationships with men that I\\'ve tolerated in my life - and a history of childhood sexual abuse, there\\'s a sense of familiarity there, of normalcy.\\n\\n\"And also this weird co-dependent relationship for me where the medicine was helping me so I didn\\'t want to speak up because I was afraid I would be ostracised from the community and then I would be kind of cut off from the medicine.\"\\n\\nRisks and benefits?\\n\\nWhile preliminary scientific studies have suggested that ayahuasca could have therapeutic benefits, it contains DMT, which is illegal in the UK, and there are potential risks.\\n\\nA 2015 report found six volunteers with depression showed a decrease in symptoms after taking it. A separate study two years later indicated that it held promise as a treatment for eating disorders. Psychologists have also speculated that it could help those with PTSD.\\n\\nThe Foreign and Commonwealth Office warns that some people have \"suffered serious illnesses and in some cases death\" after taking part in ayahuasca ceremonies. It points out that retreats are typically some distance from populated areas and that while some have basic medical facilities, others do not.\\n\\nCould ayahuasca have health benefits?\\n\\nAround the same time, a group calling themselves Ayahuasca Community Awareness Canada - which included senior academics - put their names to a letter about Arévalo\\'s behaviour and circulated it within the ayahuasca scene. The letter-writers say they took action because of the number of complaints made against the healer, citing reports of non-consensual or inappropriate sexual behaviour.\\n\\nWhen further named signatories were added to the letter in 2015 and it was made public, Arévalo stopped visiting Canada to lead ayahuasca ceremonies.\\n\\nBut when we track him down it seems he\\'s been active all around the world in the intervening years and is now based at a retreat centre in Peru. The place used to be called Anaconda but when we\\'re there has its first group of foreign guests under a new name, Bena Shinan.\\n\\nThey\\'re milling around in a dining room behind us when we put the allegations of sexual abuse to Arévalo, a slight 71-year-old with silver hair and gold teeth.\\n\\nImage copyright Getty Images Image caption Guillermo Arévalo in 2004\\n\\n\"I don\\'t accept the allegations because they\\'re not true,\" he says firmly. \"Because sometimes people just imagine these things.\"\\n\\nHe says he\\'s heard about the letter by members of the Canadian ayahuasca community, but has never read it.\\n\\n\"It doesn\\'t interest me because the allegations aren\\'t true,\" he says. \"It doesn\\'t bother me because I don\\'t think an allegation\\'s going to kill me.\"\\n\\nThe claims against him, he says, are \"the imaginings of the unwell person\".\\n\\n\"When you touch someone who\\'s been abused or raped, they think you\\'re the same. That\\'s what happens. That\\'s how I make sense of it.\"\\n\\nWhen we put Anna\\'s specific allegation to him, he says he doesn\\'t remember ever touching a patient during a ceremony in Canada, saying she too must have imagined it.\\n\\n\"What else is he going to do other than just lie and deny it,\" Anna responds. \"Otherwise he would have to step up and take responsibility and be accountable for the way he has acted.\"\\n\\nWhat about his claim that she just imagined the sexual assault?\\n\\n\"It sounds like gaslighting to me, really,\" she says. \"That\\'s what it feels like.\"\\n\\nAlthough Arévalo denies having sexually abused anyone, he does admit that healers working under him have had sex with \"unwell people\".\\n\\nHe says he no longer works with those healers, but that in some cases it was the patients who initiated the relationships.\\n\\n\"Western women, when they come, they\\'re also seeking out healers,\" he says.\\n\\nImage caption Ayahuasca on sale at Belén Market in Iquitos, Peru\\n\\nAnna\\'s experience with ayahuasca and abuse doesn\\'t end with Guillermo Arévalo. Despite her experiences with him, she didn\\'t want to give up the benefits she received from the brew and continued taking it under the guidance of other healers.\\n\\nShe says that in 2014 she was raped in ayahuasca ceremonies in Peru by a healer who is a member of Arévalo\\'s extended family.\\n\\nShe says again she \"just froze\" and \"let him do whatever he wanted to me\".\\n\\n\"I think he probably raped me four or five times and I noticed he was doing it to other people.\"\\n\\nAfterwards, Anna says she was in shock. She doesn\\'t remember much about that period of her life.\\n\\n\"I started to develop symptoms of psychosis and ended up relapsing and becoming addicted to fentanyl and overdosed and almost died. I think I really blamed myself for a long time - why I couldn\\'t say no, why I couldn\\'t move, why I let him do those things. Those were the things that were going through my mind.\"\\n\\nWe\\'ve spoken to another guest who was at the same retreat as Anna, who says the healer was later sacked from the centre, because of allegations made by other clients. We\\'re not naming him because, despite our best efforts, we haven\\'t been able to reach him to give him the chance to respond to the allegations.\\n\\nEmily Sinclair, a British doctoral student researching ayahuasca, is part of a group trying to raise awareness about the problem of sexual abuse in the ayahuasca world.\\n\\nWorking with the Chacruna Institute, an organisation set up to share research on plant medicines and psychedelics, Sinclair helped put together the Ayahuasca Community Guide for the Awareness of Sexual Abuse.\\n\\nThe guidelines highlight typical scenarios in which abuse happens. They also encourage people to drink with trusted companions and to research retreats by checking out review websites before they visit.\\n\\nSinclair has been distributing the little green booklet to cafes, tourism offices and ayahuasca centres in the Iquitos area of Peru, known as the hub of ayahuasca tourism.\\n\\nImage copyright Emily Sinclair\\n\\n\"A lot of abuse we\\'ve found occurs in the context of individual healings where a woman might be asked to remove her clothes unnecessarily,\" she says. \"And when she\\'s in this unfamiliar context, she doesn\\'t know if that\\'s normal or not.\"\\n\\nSinclair points out that it\\'s not just indigenous healers abusing Westerners. \"Abuse happens across cultures and within them,\" she says.\\n\\n\"But one of the big problems is that a lot of people who come here romanticise shamans. So we put them on a pedestal. And it\\'s very easy for that image to be taken advantage of.\\n\\n\"There\\'s also assumptions that some of the people here may have about Western women and culture.\"\\n\\nSome of the red flags Sinclair warns people to watch out for echo Rebekah\\'s experience.\\n\\nInformation and Support\\n\\n\"If he\\'s overly touchy with you, he tells you his wife doesn\\'t mind him having sex with other women, he encourages pacts of silence and secrecy between you, he says he wants to teach you \\'love magic\\'. This kind of thing. And also that having sex with them will increase their power and energy. These are all things that have been reported to us as being said to women in this context.\"\\n\\nThose affected by sexual abuse understandably find it difficult to talk about openly. On top of that, there\\'s a strong sense within the ayahuasca world that any kind of negative publicity could result in government intervention, which creates an additional pressure to stay silent.\\n\\nBut Rebekah and Anna are speaking out because they hope it will prevent other women being abused.\\n\\n\"I think the only thing we can do is just speak out about it and talk about it,\" Rebekah says, \"make sure people know that it\\'s happening.\"\\n\\nRebekah says that after she was abused there\\'s been \"a lot of sadness and a lot of therapy\".\\n\\nIt\\'s been hard work for her to trust a healer again, but now she\\'s back in Peru, taking ayahuasca and researching her master\\'s thesis on indigenous medicine.\\n\\n\"Regardless of everything that happened, obviously ayahuasca\\'s great,\" Rebekah laughs, \"because I keep going back to it.\"\\n  '},\n",

The first was that she would need to find a donor egg. The second was that Afro-Caribbean eggs are rarely donated. But she hasn\\'t given up hope.\\n\\nNatasha is 38 and is struggling to have a baby.\\n\\nShe got married in 2011, and started trying to conceive immediately. Eventually it became clear there was a problem.\\n\\n\"I actually had four rounds of IVF treatment and obviously none of them were successful. And after the third round the doctor said, \\'We doubt that your eggs are going to be any good and you probably need to consider going down the egg donation route.\\' And she literally got up from her seat and said, \\'I\\'ll give you some time with your husband to discuss,\\' and she walked out the room. And that was it.\"\\n\\nNatasha\\'s next step was to call organisations that might help her obtain a donor egg. One was a donation bank.\\n\\n\"They basically said, \\'We\\'re going to have to be honest with you, but we don\\'t have many black Afro-Caribbean egg donors come forward.\\' They told me straight and I appreciated the honesty rather than being sent on a goose chase.\"\\n\\nNatasha then cast her net further afield. A clinic in Spain offered her an egg donated by an African. Many might think this was not a bad solution, but Natasha was not sure it would be right for her.\\n\\n\"My heritage is Caribbean. My grandparents on both sides of the family are both from the Caribbean… it was important to me to at least have some cultural connection with the child, and I felt that if it was from a different heritage, I may not…\"\\n\\nImage copyright Nadia Akingbule\\n\\nShe also felt that her family, which she says \"has a big hang-up about who looks like who\", might discriminate against a child that they knew had come from a donor.\\n\\nIn 2017, about 1,900 individual donors donated eggs in the UK. Of these only 15 were categorised as \"Black Caribbean\". Twenty were Black African. The vast majority - 1,608 - were White.\\n\\nAs Black Caribbeans make up 1.1% of the population according to the 2011 census, you might expect 21 out of the 1,900 donors to have come from this group. Black Africans, meanwhile, make up 1.8%, so if 2017\\'s donor eggs had been evenly distributed by race, there would have been 34.\\n\\nDr Edmond Edi-Osagie, a reproductive medicine specialist in Cheshire says that there is \"something cultural within the black community\" that makes women reluctant to donate eggs.\\n\\n\"Any time I see an Afro-Caribbean woman over the age of 35 who walks through my clinic, the first thing I think about is, \\'Are they going to need donor eggs?\\' My heart really sinks, because I know that it\\'s going to be a really difficult battle if they are,\" he says.\\n\\nHe also finds that Afro-Caribbean women are more likely to need donor eggs, than white women of a similar age.\\n\\n\"The reasons for that we\\'re still not very clear about, and there are many plausible reasons, but that\\'s what we are finding anecdotally.\"\\n\\nEdi-Osagie has been to a number of black organisations and black churches to talk about the lack of donor eggs and the message always goes down well, he says.\\n\\n\"I get a line of people who wait to speak to me to give me their contact details and then I get my staff, over the following weeks, to try to contact all of those people - and unfortunately, almost invariably that\\'s where the trail ends,\" he says.\\n\\nFind out more:\\n\\nListen to Natasha: Trying to find a black egg donor on Monday 13 January from 20:00\\n\\nPart of the series My Name Is... on BBC Radio 4\\n\\nNatasha thinks that one reason so few eggs are donated could be that women don\\'t know there is a shortage.\\n\\n\"There\\'s no awareness, no-one\\'s printed any leaflets - it\\'s not sitting in the waiting rooms of any hospitals,\" she says.\\n\\nShe also thinks it\\'s a taboo subject that is rarely discussed in the black community.\\n\\nIf the subject is ever mentioned, it\\'s a throwaway comment like, \"Sandra up the road, she cannot have a baby,\" Natasha says.\\n\\n\"It\\'s never taken seriously about how that person must be feeling or what support they may need. It\\'s just not a topic that\\'s ever brought up and yes it does need to change, it really does,\" she says. \"Especially because women, no matter what cultural background, are having children later.

              "  'text': '\\n   Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption WATCH: Hydrogen-powered drones could point way to future air travel\\n\\nWhen you think about hydrogen and flight, the image that comes to mind for most is the Hindenburg airship in flames.\\n\\nBut in a lab deep in the basement of Imperial College in London, a young team has built what it believes is the future of air travel.\\n\\nH2Go Power is seeking a patent to store the explosive gas cheaply and safely.\\n\\nUntil now, storing hydrogen required ultra-strong and large tanks which could withstand pressures of up to 10,000 pound-force per square inch (psi). That is hundreds of times greater than what you would find in a car tyre.\\n\\nBut, while studying for her PhD in Cambridge, Dr Enass Abo-Hamed came up with a revolutionary structure which could store hydrogen as a stable solid without compression.\\n\\n\"The pressure involved is similar to what you\\'d get in a coffee machine,\" she says.\\n\\nThe university paired her with materials scientist, Luke Sperrin, to try to find commercial applications for the innovation - and H2Go Power was born.\\n\\nTest flight\\n\\nDr Sperrin is now chief technology officer. He and Dr Abo-Hamed formed a partnership with Canadian hydrogen fuel cell maker Ballard a year ago to create a drone which used their reactor to safely store hydrogen for flight.\\n\\nFinally, after months of collaboration by phone and email, Mr Sperrin and chief product developer Peter Italiano flew to Boston for a ground-breaking test flight.\\n\\n\"Of course you need really good weather to fly a drone,\" smiles Mr Sperrin.\\n\\n\"And it poured with rain for the first few days. We weren\\'t even sure whether we\\'d even be able to go ahead.\\n\\n\"So when it did fly, it was a huge relief.\"\\n\\nImage copyright H2Go Power Image caption Hydrogen-powered drone developed by Ballard and H2Go Power\\n\\nHow it works\\n\\nThe aluminium reactor weighs less than a bag of sugar.\\n\\nThe small gas cylinder has an intricate network of 3D-printed aluminium tubes inside.\\n\\nThe hydrogen remains stable and solid in these structures until \"coolant\" is pumped through the tubes, warming them and releasing hydrogen gas to the drone\\'s fuel cell\\n\\nHydrogen (H2) is pumped into one side of the fuel cell through a catalyst which frees electrons, creating electricity.\\n\\nOxygen (O) is then pumped into the other side of the fuel cell and combines with the left over, positively-charged hydrogen atoms (H+).\\n\\nThe only final waste product is water vapour (H2O).\\n\\nNever-ending supply\\n\\nUntil recently, a major hurdle to affordable hydrogen technologies was the cost of producing hydrogen gas.\\n\\nSplitting water molecules into hydrogen used a lot of energy which usually came from fossil fuel sources.\\n\\nHowever, the widespread availability of renewable energy and improvements in electrolysis - the chemical process of separating elements using electricity - have brought down the financial and environmental cost of producing hydrogen for fuel.\\n\\nCurrently most countries have strict safety rules about flying drones over heavily populated areas.\\n\\nCollision or technical failure could cause a drone to drop out of the sky.\\n\\nLithium-ion (Li-on) batteries are highly flammable, so a crash landing could trigger an explosion.\\n\\nBut, Dr Abo-Hamed points out, even if their drone fell out of the sky, the hydrogen would remain stable in its solid form inside the reactor.\\n\\nImage copyright H2Go Power Image caption Dr Enass Abo-Hamed got the idea for the hydrogen reactor while working on her PhD\\n\\nSuper fuel\\n\\n\"Hydrogen is a happy gas,\" continues Dr Abo-Hamed. \"It wants to move around.\"\\n\\nThat\\'s what makes it so explosive. But, it also delivers more bang for your buck.\\n\\nHydrogen generates three times as much power per kilogram compared to fossil fuels - approximately 39.0 Kilowatt hours per kilogram compared with roughly 13 kWh per kg for kerosene or petrol or just 0.2 kWh for conventional lithium ion batteries.\\n\\nThat means a hydrogen-powered drone can fly further than a battery-powered drone and, potentially, carry heavier loads.\\n\\nDr Abo-Hamed is excited about the possibilities for her innovation.\\n\\n\"So if drones could stay longer in the sky, they can deliver medicine,\" she says. \"Or scan a disaster area and send the information back.\\n\\n\"My dream really is not just to make drones.\\n\\n\"Maybe in the next twenty or thirty years we could de-carbonise air travel, which is something really important for our climate.\"\\n  '},\n",

It predicts a world where machines are firmly in control.\\n\\nBut those conversations were taken less and less seriously as the decade went on. At the end of 2019, the smartest computers could still only excel at a \"narrow\" selection of tasks.\\n\\nGary Marcus, an AI researcher at New York University, said: \"By the end of the decade there was a growing realisation that current techniques can only carry us so far.\"\\n\\nHe thinks the industry needs some \"real innovation\" to go further.\\n\\n\"There is a general feeling of plateau,\" said Verena Rieser, a professor in conversational AI at Edinburgh\\'s Herriot Watt University.\\n\\nOne AI researcher who wishes to remain anonymous said we\\'re entering a period where we are especially sceptical about AGI.\\n\\n\"The public perception of AI is increasingly dark: the public believes AI is a sinister technology,\" they said.\\n\\nFor its part, DeepMind has a more optimistic view of AI\\'s potential, suggesting that as yet \"we\\'re only just scratching the surface of what might be possible\".\\n\\n\"As the community solves and discovers more, further challenging problems open up,\" explained Koray Kavukcuoglu, its vice president of research.\\n\\n\"This is why AI is a long-term scientific research journey.\\n\\n\"We believe AI will be one of the most powerful enabling technologies ever created - a single invention that could unlock solutions to thousands of problems. The next decade will see renewed efforts to generalise the capabilities of AI systems to help achieve that potential - both building on methods that have already been successful and researching how to build general-purpose AI that can tackle a wide range of tasks.\"\\n\\n\\'Far to go\\'\\n\\nWhile AGI isn\\'t going to be created any time soon, machines have learned how to master complex tasks like:\\n\\nplaying the ancient Chinese board game Go\\n\\nidentifying human faces\\n\\ntranslating text into practically every language\\n\\nspotting tumours\\n\\ndriving cars\\n\\nidentifying animals.\\n\\nThe relevance of these advances was overhyped at times, says ex-DeepMinder Edward Grefenstette, who now works in the Facebook AI Research group as a research scientist.\\n\\nImage copyright Facebook Image caption Edward Grefenstette is a research scientist at Facebook in London\\n\\n\"The field has come a very long way in the past decade, but we are very much aware that we still have far to go in scientific and technological advances to make machines truly intelligent,\" he said.\\n\\n\"One of the biggest challenges is to develop methods that are much more efficient in terms of the data and compute power required to learn to solve a problem well. In the past decade, we\\'ve seen impressive advances made by increasing the scale of data and computation available, but that\\'s not appropriate or scalable for every problem.\\n\\n\"If we want to scale to more complex behaviour, we need to do better with less data, and we need to generalise more.\"\\n\\nNeil Lawrence, who recently left Amazon and joined the University of Cambridge as the first DeepMind-funded professor of machine learning, thinks that the AI industry is very much still in the \"wonder years\".\\n\\nReality check\\n\\nSo what will AI look like at the end of the 20s, and how will researchers go about developing it?\\n\\n\"In the next decade, I hope we\\'ll see a more measured, realistic view of AI\\'s capability, rather than the hype we\\'ve seen so far,\" said Catherine Breslin, an ex-Amazon AI researcher.\\n\\nThe term \"AI\" became a real buzzword through the last decade, with companies of all shapes and sizes latching onto the term, often for marketing purposes.\\n\\n\"The manifold of things which were lumped into the term \"AI\" will be recognised and discussed separately,\" said Samim Winiger, a former AI researcher at Google in Berlin.\\n\\n\"What we called \\'AI\\' or \\'machine learning\\' during the past 10-20 years, will be seen as just yet another form of \\'computation\\'\".\\n  '},\n",

These reductions are then deducted from the main company\\'s own output.\\n\\nThe result of this slows carbon emissions rather than reversing them.\\n\\nTo be carbon negative a company must actually remove more carbon from the atmosphere than it emits.\\n\\nMicrosoft says it will do this using a range of carbon capture and storage technologies.\\n\\nThe announcement was largely welcomed by environmentalists, who said it showed Microsoft was thinking about the bigger climate change picture and not just its own role.\\n\\n\"It\\'s a hat trick of sustainability leadership,\" said Elizabeth Sturcken from the Environmental Defence Fund.\\n\\n\"But to really shift the needle on climate change, we need 1,000 other [companies] to follow-suit and turn rhetoric into action.\"\\n\\nHowever, Greenpeace warned that Microsoft still needed to address its ongoing relationship with oil and gas companies.\\n\\n\"While there is a lot to celebrate in Microsoft\\'s announcement, a gaping hole remains unaddressed: Microsoft\\'s expanding efforts to help fossil fuel companies drill more oil and gas with machine-learning and other AI technologies,\" said senior campaigner Elizabeth Jardim.\\n\\nMicrosoft\\'s plan is still more aggressive than those taken by other tech firms, including Facebook, Google, Apple and Amazon, which have not made \"carbon negative\" commitments.\\n\\nHow will Microsoft achieve its goal?\\n\\nMicrosoft has suggested a range of ways it could remove carbon from the atmosphere, including:\\n\\nseeding new forests and expanding existing ones\\n\\nand expanding existing ones soil carbon sequestration - a process of putting carbon back into the ground.

The government\\'s Access to Work Scheme allows employers to access money for any \"extra disability related costs of working that are beyond standard reasonable adjustments people have when starting work or maintaining employment\".\\n\\nBut for David, back at Universal, as we chat, he smiles at the strides his company has made in this area.\\n\\n\"Part of our job is to meet a lot of people.

We will apply the rules.\"\\n\\nBut on Friday Mr Lewis said deporting EU citizens who have not applied for settled status \"is not what we\\'re about\".\\n\\nIn an interview for the BBC\\'s Politics East programme, to be shown on Sunday, he said his focus was on encouraging people to apply now.\\n\\nMr Lewis added: \"At the end of June 2021, if people haven\\'t applied and they\\'ve got good reason for that, we\\'ll be looking at that and we\\'ll be looking to grant status.\\n\\n\"But I don\\'t want to get to that place. I want people to apply now.\"\\n\\nWhen asked if police could be knocking on people\\'s in June next year and escorting them out of the country if they have not applied, he said: \"That is not what we\\'re about, we\\'re saying to people who have made their home here, \\'we value you we want you to stay.\\'\"\\n\\nImage copyright EPA Image caption Guy Verhofstadt is the European Parliament\\'s Brexit co-ordinator and a former prime minister of Belgium\\n\\nMr Verhofstadt told Today he had been told that the UK government was looking at the possibility of EU citizens being able to print out documentary proof of their status.\\n\\nResponding to his comments, the Home Office said: \"There is no change to our digital approach. It has always been the case that people could print a copy of their confirmation letter, but this can\\'t be used as evidence of status.\"\\n\\nIt added: \"The EU settlement scheme grants people with a secure, digital status which future-proofs their rights. Physical documents can get lost, stolen, damaged and tampered with.\"\\n\\nMr Verhofstadt also said the possibility had been raised of EU citizens sitting on the independent monitoring authority that will be in place to oversee citizens\\' rights.\\n\\nAsked whether he thought the UK could ever rejoin the EU in the future, Mr Verhofstadt said he thought it would eventually happen but \"difficult to say when\".\\n\\n\"There will be a young generation who will say, \\'What have we done? We want to go back,\\'\" he added.\\n\\nConservative MEP Daniel Hannan praised the UK government\\'s handling of the issue of citizens\\' rights, saying: \"A system is now up and running, and it is by far the most effective and the most generous in any of the EU countries.\\n\\n\"I don\\'t think you will find a single state among the [other] 27 [EU states] that has a system in place to grant rights to established UK nationals that is working as generously and without any cost to the people concerned, as ours is in return.\"\\n  '},\n",

It also said that a lack of child seat belts and drunk driving contribute to the high death toll.\\n\\nRules ignored\\n\\n\"Whereas 60% of countries with laws meeting best practice are from the European region, only 2% are from the African region,\" the WHO report said.\\n\\nIt added that in many countries, vulnerable road users, such as pedestrians, are largely ignored in the planning, design and operation of roads.\\n\\nTravelling around Nairobi, it is clear that makeshift markets and hawking can block people on foot and encroach on the highway, forcing people to walk on the road.\\n\\nImage caption Pedestrians often have to walk on the roads as traders take up the pavement\\n\\nMr Meja said the WHO recommends that 10% of total road construction costs are spent on safety initiatives - but in Kenya the figure is less than 1%.\\n\\nHe told the BBC there is more the government can do to protect the vulnerable and create awareness.\\n\\nBut a recent study by the Overseas Development Institute said that persuading people to behave more safely would not solve the problem as the underlying causes of incidents, such as road design and better urban planning, need to be addressed.\\n\\nIn the meantime pedestrians, like Ms Wambui\\'s daughter and grandson, will continue to pay a heavy price because road designs prioritise cars and other motorised transport.\\n  '},\n",

There\\'s a strong wish to neutralise any influence that [former] President Dos Santos might still have in the MPLA,\" Ms Dos Santos said.\\n\\n\"If a different candidate would appear [ahead of the 2022 presidential election] supported by former President Dos Santos or allies linked to him, that would really challenge [Mr Lourenço\\'s] position because his current track record is very, very poor,\" she added, citing rising unemployment, a stagnant economy and a wave of strikes.\\n\\nBut the allegations of corruption aimed at Ms Dos Santos and her half-brother have been given new weight by the criminal investigations launched against her in Angola.\\n\\n\"The reality is that there is more than enough evidence against her. She\\'s a key figure in the Dos Santos family and a credible threat to Lourenço,\" said Darias Jonker, a regional analyst for the Eurasia Group, who said that legitimate allegations of corruption were being wielded by the state as part of a vicious power struggle within the MPLA.\\n\\n\"Lourenço is sending a signal that there\\'s a new sheriff in town, with new rules,\" Mr Jonker added.\\n\\n\"He needs his own patronage network, but his model is much more modest - he won\\'t allow the multi-billion-dollar patronage deals that were a hallmark of the Dos Santos era. Would Isabel support some sort of palace coup? I think it\\'s something she\\'d certainly consider.\"\\n\\nImage caption José Filomeno dos Santos is on trial for corruption\\n\\nMs Dos Santos insisted she was being used as a \"scapegoat\" by President Lourenço, and lashed out at the justice system in Angola, accusing the attorney general of \"lying\" and of refusing to allow her lawyers to see the evidence against her.\\n\\n\"I regret that Angola has chosen this path. I think that we all stand to lose a lot. A good leader is a prudent leader,\" she said, calling for a negotiated political solution to end her current legal battles and any further damage to the Angolan economy.\\n\\nCould she actually win an election?\\n\\nBut could she, or perhaps a proxy or ally, oust the current president and pave the way for a triumphant homecoming?\\n\\n\"I am a businesswoman. A lot of people… do like me and do understand what I do and do believe in what I do.\\n\\n\"There are thousands of people whom we gave their first job,\" she said, highlighting her business credentials, and rejecting the widespread perception that she owes much of her fortune to her father\\'s long presidency as \"voices that come from the political opposition\".\\n\\nImage copyright Getty Images Image caption Angola\\'s economy has boomed because of oil\\n\\nBut some observers have been quick to play down the idea of a Dos Santos dynasty with Isabel - derided, for years, as \"The Princess\" in Angola - filling her father\\'s shoes.\\n\\n\"Isabel doesn\\'t have a strong constituency in her favour inside the party. For now, the party is behind Lourenço, at least when it comes to the targeting of Isabel,\" said Ricardo Soares de Oliveira, an Oxford professor and expert on African politics.\\n\\n\"If he turns what is still a focused vendetta against the Dos Santos family into a systemic clean-up, the MPLA would not accept it and might even rediscover Dos Santos as the guy who enabled all of them to get rich. But there is no sign of this,\" the Oxford professor added.\\n\\n\"Dos Santos and Isabel remain deeply unpopular in the country and the party alike. I am not writing her off entirely but she is genuinely weakened by these ongoing revelations and her international standing is deteriorating fast.\"\\n\\nWith much of her fortune still thought to be intact outside Angola, Ms Dos Santos remains a formidable force.\\n\\nIf she were to seek the presidency - and in the interview, she stressed that her commercial battles were not necessarily best resolved by political manoeuvres - she would first need the law to change in Angola as she is currently ineligible to stand because her mother is Russian.\\n\\nBut those who have watched her remarkable business career, and her furious public assault on Angola\\'s current political elites, agree that such an obstacle is unlikely to prove insurmountable.\\n  '},\n",

              "  'text': '\\n   Image caption A screengrab of a Chinese TV report on the drone findings\\n\\nAt first it seems like a quirky, what-are-the-chances-of-that headline: \"China rewards fishers who netted foreign spy devices.\"\\n\\nBut behind that headline in Chinese state media, there is a different - and more intriguing - story.\\n\\nFirstly, this wasn\\'t two or three fishermen receiving awards. It was 11 - one woman, the rest men - who found seven devices in total.\\n\\nSecondly, this wasn\\'t the first time fishermen from Jiangsu had found \"spy drones\". In 2018, some 18 were rewarded for finding nine devices. There was also a ceremony a year earlier.\\n\\nAnd thirdly, the rewards were huge - up to 500,000 yuan ($72,000; £55,000) - around 17 times the average disposable income in China.\\n\\nSo where do the \"submarine spies\" come from? What do they do? Why are they valuable?\\n\\nAnd why are Chinese fishermen finding so many?\\n\\nImage copyright Weibo Image caption The 11 award-winners in Jiangsu\\n\\nJiangsu is a province in eastern China, with a coastline more than 1,000km (620 miles) long.\\n\\nIt faces Japan and South Korea, while Taiwan is around 500 miles south. This geography - and the huge US presence in the region - begins to explain why fishermen keep finding these devices.\\n\\nChina has not revealed where the devices came from, merely saying they were \"made in other countries\".\\n\\nBut regional expert and consultant Alexander Neill says they probably came from \"the US Navy, the Japan Self-Defense Forces, or potentially Taiwan - this is a big area of rivalry\".\\n\\nSo what are the Americans, the Japanese, or the Taiwanese hoping to learn?\\n\\nIn 2009, the US Navy sponsored research into underwater drones, broadly known as \"unmanned undersea vehicles (UUVs)\". The research recommended seven ways UUVs could be used, including:\\n\\nTracking \"potentially adversary submarines\"\\n\\nLooking for and dealing with underwater bombs - particularly in other countries\\' waters\\n\\nDeploying surveillance equipment\\n\\nMonitoring \"undersea infrastructure\", such as communication cables\\n\\nThe research also highlighted the strengths of UUVs. Gliders - a smaller UUV, likely to be what the Jiangsu fishermen found - can be deployed for \"months\" and are \"cheap enough to be considered expendable\".\\n\\nIn this instance, cheap means \"only tens of thousands of dollars\".\\n\\nTheir cost, range, and capability mean \"submarine spies\" are increasingly important - Mr Neill estimates the number worldwide is \"certainly in the upper hundreds\".\\n\\nSo this explains - in part - why they keep turning up in Chinese nets. The country has a huge fishing fleet, and the law of averages suggests it will scoop up the occasional drone.\\n\\nBut it\\'s also true that China\\'s fleet is different to other countries\\'. Some fishermen, themselves, are part of the military - and understanding how this unique unit works could explain why they keep finding military hardware.\\n\\nMedia playback is unsupported on your device Media caption BBC News looks at how powerful China\\'s military is, compared to that of the USA\\n\\nThe Chinese Maritime Militia is part of the national militia - that is, the reserve civilian forces.\\n\\nIt is \"virtually unique and publicly obscure\", according to Professor Andrew S. Erickson from the US Naval War College - but it is well-known to the United States military.\\n\\nAccording to a 2017 report by the US Department of Defense, the CMM has played \"significant roles in a number of military campaigns and coercive incidents over the years\".\\n\\nIn the past, the CMM rented vessels from companies or fishermen. But now, the DoD says, \"it appears China is building a state-owned fishing fleet for its militia force\".\\n\\nIndeed, Mr Neill says many boats are merely \"masquerading as fishing vessels - they\\'re actually doing naval and maritime surveillance against China\\'s rivals\".\\n\\n\"On paper they look like sophisticated, modern trawlers,\" he says. \"But they are actually, essentially, military-type vessels - steel-hulled, not wooden-hulled, with increasing tonnage.\\n\\n\"If you look at photographs, it\\'s clear they\\'re networked in - because of their signalling capabilities - with the [regular navy] command and control network.\"\\n\\nIn effect, the fishing fleet can provide a low-level, first line of defence or surveillance - a military force working under a civilian cloak.\\n\\n\"A very significant swathe of China\\'s fishing fleet is co-opted into the militia,\" says Mr Neill.\\n\\n\"I would have thought, with a little digging, you would find these guys [the Jiangsu fishermen] may well be part of it.\"\\n\\nImage copyright Getty Images Image caption The HSU001\\n\\nChina doesn\\'t just find underwater drones - it operates them, too.\\n\\nAt the military parade to mark the 70th anniversary of the People\\'s Republic of China (PRC), the HSU001 was unveiled - a large UUV, possibly capable of launching smaller drones.\\n\\nAnd five months earlier, another Chinese UUV was revealed in a less formal way, when Indonesian fishermen caught a \"missile\" with Chinese markings in the Riau Islands.\\n\\n\"It\\'s not a missile, but a sea drone, which is usually used for underwater research,\" said police.\\n\\nAlthough its origin was not confirmed, experts suspect it was part of China\\'s vast sub-surface surveillance - the so-called \"Great Underwater Wall of China\".\\n\\nSo, as UUV technology develops, more fishermen - whether in China, Indonesia, or beyond - can expect to find more drones.\\n\\n\"They [drones] are extending the range of surveillance capacity for all of the modern navies in the region,\" says Mr Neill.\\n\\nAnd - as the Jiangsu prize-winners discovered - they can be a valuable catch.\\n  '},\n",

She was determined not to let the same happen to her, with the media appeal her last chance.\\n\\nAnd it appeared to work: the donations flooded in. But it wasn\\'t enough to save Wu, who died on Monday aged 24.\\n\\nThose who had been rooting for her were devastated, but there was worse to come. It transpired the money they had given - or at least the vast majority of it - never reached Wy Huayan. Official records seem to suggest just 20,000 yuan ($2,900; £2,225) was paid towards her hospital bills.\\n\\nIt has left many asking: how on earth did the system let this young woman down - and who exactly is to blame?\\n\\nThe campaign to save Wu Huayan\\n\\nThe first pictures of Wu Huayan - her 135cm (4ft 5ins) visibly emaciated - were released in October. She and her brother, who is understood to have mental health issues, had been relying on an uncle and aunt for support, but they could only provide 300 yuan ($43.60; £33.45) each month. After her brother\\'s medical bills, there was only two yuan a day left for Miss Wu\\'s food.\\n\\nImmediately, people began to donate. The money was collected by Charity 9958, a project under the China Charities Aid Foundation for Children (CCAFC), using two different funding platforms. It was meant to help pay for heart surgery.\\n\\nImage copyright Weibo Image caption The fundraising page drew in tens of thousands of yuan\\n\\nBut it never happened. According to reports, Miss Wu never gained enough weight to undergo the operation. According to official media, she weighed less than 30kg when she died.\\n\\nThe corruption allegations\\n\\nWithin days of her death, a scandal began to emerge. A state-media outlet called The Cover accused 9958 of running \"a deadly scam\".\\n\\nZheng Hehong, a prominent activist and former member of staff at 9958, came out alleging the charity sought out particularly ill or vulnerable people, and then withheld funds as part of a ploy to keep the proceeds as long as possible.\\n\\n\"They waited until the patient died so they could take the interest income,\" she told Phoenix New Media\\'s Ifeng.com. \"This income, by law, can be given as a staff bonus instead of charitable aid.\"\\n\\nBut the charity has hit back, saying it was holding onto the money on her family\\'s request. They said it had not been paid because she had not met the criteria needed to undergo the surgery - and that it had planned to release the funds afterwards.\\n\\nHowever, one acquaintance told The Cover that Ms Wu didn\\'t even know about 400,000 yuan of the money.\\n\\nImage copyright Pear Video Image caption Miss Wu arrived in hospital with breathing difficulties\\n\\nThen, further complications: 9958 said it had stopped raising donations for Miss Wu after local government officials said that they would \"take care\" of the third year university student and her family.\\n\\nThe town has denied this, saying they had not been in contact with 9958.\\n\\nA wider problem?\\n\\nBut is it all as simple as that? There have been a series of high profile scandals involving Chinese charities in recent years, journalist David Paulk points out in a Twitter thread.\\n\\nThey include charities set up to help girls but which gave money to boys, and one which used duplicate photos as it encouraged people to donate to impoverished children, the news editor of Sixth Tone explained in a Twitter thread.\\n\\nBut conversely, the CCAFC - the parent body of 9958 - was named China\\'s most transparent charity in 2019 \"achieving a perfect score of 100\".\\n\\nImage copyright People\\'s Daily Image caption Pictures of eight-year-old Little Wang were shared tens of thousands of times\\n\\nRegardless, BBC Monitoring\\'s Kerry Allen says that China\\'s official media have acknowledged that there has been \"chaos and confusion\" in China\\'s charity industry. The official China Daily says that there are \"too many overlapping authorities and liabilities\", and called for better regulation, saying that online charity fraud has become rife.\\n\\nThe publicity surrounding stories like Ms Wu\\'s has also left charities wary of taking on similar cases, for fear the repercussions of being blamed for not doing enough.\\n\\nThe South China Morning Post noted that Wang Fuman, an impoverished schoolboy who touched the nation\\'s hearts after a picture of him with frost in his hair went viral, had been granted a happy ending by being offered a place at a private school. However, it was later retracted because the school could not cope with \"the intense extra scrutiny from the authorities and pressure from the media\".\\n\\nChina\\'s government media has also been wary about the potential of families exploiting their children for online fame and donations. Wang Fuman\\'s father told Inkstone News that funds donated to his son were withheld amid allegations the family were being \"greedy\" and distributed to other \"ice boys\". \"Our family only received a small amount of money,\" he told the site.\\n\\nBut reports contradicting a \"happy ending\" in such cases have never reached mainland China, where media is heavily regulated.\\n\\nConsequently, Ms Wu\\'s death has angered social media users in the country, and led to suspicions that local governments are taking a cut of charity funds for themselves. Many have noted scandals where former officials in the impoverished region have been able to live a life of excess.\\n\\nMedia playback is unsupported on your device Media caption China\\'s uphill struggle fighting extreme poverty\\n\\nThe government are likely to be keen to shift any blame away from their officials, as they have been working hard to paint them in more positive light and point towards successes in poverty alleviation.\\n\\nChina\\'s Communist Party has said it wants to eradicate extreme poverty by the end of 2020, trumpeting success in places like Jiangsu province - which claims it has just 17 people living in poverty.\\n\\nStories like that of Ms Wu and her little brother, then, are not what it wants to see making headlines.\\n  '},\n",

She found it was linked to hospital admissions for a wider range of conditions than previously thought.\\n\\nAs well as the known effects on the lungs and heart, her team identified \"new diseases including septicaemia which is a serious bloodstream infection... urinary tract infections and renal failure,\" she told ABC News.\\n\\nBushfire pollution does not typically do as much lasting damage as traffic or industry pollution, according to Associate Prof Brian Oliver, an expert in respiratory disease from the University of Technology, Sydney, because conditions often lift with a change in weather.\\n\\nThis means any breathing discomfort is mostly short-lived.\\n\\nBut because many fires have been burning for weeks, and authorities warn that there is no immediate end in sight, experts say this should now be treated as medium-term exposure.\\n\\nWho is this affecting?\\n\\nBushfires have been burning across the country, often sending smoke over populated areas.\\n\\nResidents of Sydney - Australia\\'s largest city - have endured smoke for weeks. The city\\'s air quality has exceeded \"hazardous\" levels on several occasions.\\n\\nThat has led to a 10% rise in hospital admissions, say officials. Paramedics have treated hundreds of people for breathing problems.\\n\\nAdelaide - a city of 1.3 million - was also affected last month, with its residents told to stay indoors.\\n\\nBecause PM2.5 particles found in bushfire smoke are so small - a ninth of the size of a grain of sand - they can travel huge distances on the wind, potentially affecting many more people. The smoke is expected to make \"at least one full circuit around the globe,\" according to the US space agency Nasa.\\n\\nMost vulnerable are children, the elderly and smokers, while those with asthma, heart and lung problems can see exacerbated symptoms - such as chest tightness and difficulty breathing.\\n\\nAnd, as competitors in the Australia Open tennis tournament have experienced, athletes can be more susceptible to smoke damage because they are breathing in larger volumes of air as they exercise.\\n\\nThe more intense the exercise, the more extra air will be taken in.\\n\\nStandard face masks are ineffective when it comes to blocking out fine particles, according to health authorities. They warned people to avoid exercising outdoors this week - a suggestion that many have ignored.\\n\\nImage copyright Getty Images Image caption Many have continued to exercise outdoors despite the risks\\n\\nHow bad has Australia\\'s air quality been?\\n\\nAustralia\\'s clear air standard is a PM2.5 level of eight micrograms per cubic metre. By comparison, smoking a single cigarette produces 20 micrograms per cubic metre.\\n\\nRecent readings in Sydney have been as high as 734 micrograms - the equivalent of about 37 cigarettes.\\n\\nMedia playback is unsupported on your device Media caption The heavy smoke haze over Sydney last month\\n\\nWhat about \\'thunderstorm asthma\\'?\\n\\nSmoke is an obvious health hazard that can travel vast distances from the fire front. But the weather stoking the flames has created other issues too, such as dust storms.\\n\\nIn Victoria, officials issued an \"extreme\" warning in November for a phenomenon known as \"thunderstorm asthma\".\\n\\nThis is where strong winds create more pollen in the air, which can lead to an outbreak of asthma attacks. In 2016, nine people died in Melbourne from just such an outbreak.\\n\\nBushfires can actually create their own weather systems, which may exacerbate this effect, according to Rachel Badlan, a researcher at the University of New South Wales.\\n\\nIf it covers a large enough area, the upward movement of hot air from a fire can interact with the atmosphere and form a pyrocumulonimbus - a cloud of smoke, ash and water vapour which comes alongside massive thunderstorms.\\n\\nPollutants from these storms are flung into the stratosphere - more than 10km into the earth\\'s atmosphere - according to Nasa.\\n\\nReporting by the BBC\\'s Frances Mao.

Many parts of Australia have been in drought conditions, some for years, which has made it easier for the fires to spread and grow.\\n\\nData shows that Australia has warmed overall by slightly more than one degree Celsius since 1910, with most of the heating occurring since 1950, the Bureau of Meteorology says.\\n\\nAustralia broke its all-time temperature record twice in December. An average maximum of 40.9C was recorded on 17 December, broken a day later by 41.9C, both beating 2013\\'s record of 40.3C.\\n\\nBy the end of the month every state had measured temperatures above 40C - including Tasmania, which is usually much cooler than the mainland.\\n\\nA climate phenomenon is behind the heatwave\\n\\nThe main climate driver behind the heat has been a positive Indian Ocean Dipole (IOD) - an event where sea surface temperatures are warmer in the western half of the ocean, cooler in the east.\\n\\nThe difference between the two temperatures is currently the strongest in 60 years.\\n\\nAs a result, there has been higher-than-average rainfall and floods in eastern Africa and droughts in south-east Asia and Australia.\\n\\nAndrew Watkins, head of long-range forecasts at the bureau, said the dipole was crucial to understanding the heatwave.\\n\\n\"The key culprit of our current and expected conditions is one of the strongest positive Indian Ocean dipole events on record,\" he says.\\n\\n\"A positive IOD means we have cooler than average water pooling off Indonesia, and this means we see less rain-bearing weather systems, and warmer than average temperatures for large parts of the country.\"\\n\\nAnd meteorologists warn that, for the moment, the intense weather and elevated fire risk in Australia is set to continue.\\n  '},\n",

What about the people who have nowhere to live?\"\\n\\nAs Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison toured a bushfire-ravaged town on Thursday, he was loudly heckled by locals. The anger towards him in Cobargo, New South Wales, was palpable. But most awkward - and attention-grabbing - were two quieter encounters.\\n\\nIn one, Mr Morrison approached a woman and asked \"how are you?\" When she failed to meet his hand, he reached down and lifted hers for a limp handshake.\\n\\nShe responded: \"I\\'m only shaking your hand if you give more money to RFS [Rural Fire Service].

The prime minister has faced persistent accusations of being too absent, including by taking a holiday to Hawaii, and underplaying the role of climate change.\\n\\nFires as big as small countries\\n\\nSince September, blazes across Australia have killed 20 people, razed more than 1,200 homes and scorched millions of hectares. Though much attention has centred on worst-hit NSW, every state and territory has been affected.\\n\\nSmoke has shrouded towns and cities in Australia\\'s most populated south-east, bringing hazardous air quality to millions of people. Millions of animals are estimated to have perished, and the economic cost is predicted to be enormous.\\n\\nPublic gratitude has been boundless for the fatigued firefighters - overwhelmingly volunteers - who have battled blazes as big as small countries. Three have died on duty. Fire service chiefs, such as Commissioner Shane Fitzsimmons in NSW, have often been the face of the crisis.\\n\\nTo critics of Mr Morrison, those chiefs have provided a stark contrast in leadership. On Friday, a high-profile member of Mr Morrison\\'s own party made a withering critique.\\n\\n\"The only two people who are providing leadership at this stage are Shane Fitzsimmons and [NSW Premier] Gladys Berejiklian,\" Andrew Constance, the state transport minister, told Seven News.\\n\\nOf the heckling, Mr Constance added: \"To be honest, the locals probably gave him the welcome he probably deserved.\"\\n\\nWhat has prompted the anger?\\n\\nEarly in the crisis, criticism centred on Mr Morrison\\'s reluctance to discuss how climate change is exacerbating bushfires - a link acknowledged by Australia\\'s Bureau of Meteorology.\\n\\nThough he has since acknowledged it as a factor, the conservative leader maintains there is no direct link between the fires and his climate policies. This has continued to cause controversy because of Australia\\'s reliance on coal mining.\\n\\nBut as the fires have spread, Mr Morrison has been accused of \"going missing\" in other ways.

But the biggest fires burn along stretches of the eastern and southern coast, where most of the population lives.\\n\\nThis includes areas around Sydney and Adelaide.\\n\\nHow big are the Australia fires?\\n\\nMore than 6.3 million hectares (63,000 sq km or 15.6 million acres) have been burned so far - one hectare is roughly the size of a sports field.\\n\\nImage copyright EPA\\n\\nTo put that in perspective, around 800,000 hectares in 2018 in California.\\n\\nHow did the Australia fires start?\\n\\nAustralia has always experienced bushfires - it has a \"fire season\". But this year they are a lot worse than normal.\\n\\nFires are usually caused by lightning strikes or accidentally by a spark - but some fires are also started deliberately.\\n\\nImage copyright Getty Images Image caption Sydney has been covered by thick smoke from bushfires outside of the city\\n\\nAre the Australia fires caused by climate change?\\n\\nThis year a natural weather phenomenon known as the Indian Ocean Dipole has meant a hot, dry spell across the country.\\n\\nBut the overwhelming scientific consensus is that rising levels of CO2 are warming the planet. And Australia has been getting hotter over recent decades and is expected to continue doing so.\\n\\nThis year, Australia twice set a new temperature record: an average maximum of 41.9C was recorded on 18 December. That comes on top of a long period of drought.\\n\\nScientists have long warned that this hotter, drier climate will contribute to fires becoming more frequent and more intense.\\n\\nThe more extreme weather patterns and higher temperatures increase the risk of bushfires and allow them to spread faster and wider.\\n\\nHow are the fires fought?\\n\\nFirefighters are spraying water and fire retardant from planes and helicopters as well as from the ground.\\n\\nBut fighting bush fires is extremely difficult and often authorities have to focus on just stopping the spread, rather than putting the fire out.\\n\\nThe spread can for instance be contained by digging earth boundaries to stop the flames from spreading. The priority is saving lives.\\n\\nWho is fighting the fires?\\n\\nProfessional firefighters are the first in line to battle the flames, but they are outnumbered by the thousands of volunteers. Three of them have died.\\n\\nThere\\'s also help coming from abroad: the US, Canada, and New Zealand have sent firefighters to help.\\n\\nAustralia\\'s police, military and navy are involved in rescue and evacuation efforts.\\n\\nHow many animals have died in the fires?\\n\\nWhile people can flee the fires and are being evacuated if need be, the flames are devastating wildlife in the affected areas.\\n\\nOne study estimated that half a billion animals have died in NSW alone. Read more on how they reached that conclusion here.\\n\\nBut the fires don\\'t only kill animals directly, they also destroy the habitat, leaving the survivors vulnerable even once the fires have gone. So the true scale of loss isn\\'t yet clear.\\n\\nExperts say more than 100,000 cows and sheep may also have been lost, which is devastating for farmers.\\n\\nWhat is the government doing?\\n\\nEach state runs its own emergency operation, but Prime Minister Scott Morrison has promised better funding for firefighting and payouts for volunteer firefighters, and an additional A$2bn ($1.4bn; £1bn) for the recovery.\\n\\nMedia playback is unsupported on your device Media caption \"You\\'re an idiot, mate\": Australian PM Scott Morrison heckled by bushfire victims\\n\\nBut the national government has come under strong criticism from its opponents that it\\'s not been doing enough against climate change.\\n\\nThe country is one of the world\\'s biggest per capita greenhouse gas emitters but under international agreements it has committed itself to reduction targets.\\n\\nMr Morrison has repeatedly defended his government\\'s stance.\\n\\nDo you have any questions about the Australia fires?\\n\\nIn some cases your question will be published, displaying your name, age and location as you provide it, unless you state otherwise.

The pilot, contracted by the Rural Fire Service, survived.\\n\\nOn the ground, teams are also using firefighting trucks and \"heavy plant\" equipment, such as bulldozers and excavators, in order to move earth, clear areas of debris and create \"firebreaks\" - gaps in vegetation that help slow the advance of flames.\\n\\nNSW Rural Fire Service says it has more than 750 vehicles on the ground on a given day.\\n\\nImage copyright Getty Images\\n\\nMilitary aircraft and navy cruisers are also being used alongside Australian fire service kit.\\n\\nThe army said it had sent supplies, personnel, and vehicles to the devastated Kangaroo Island, near the city of Adelaide in South Australia.\\n\\nThe army also sent out reconnaissance and assistance missions in NSW and Victoria.\\n\\nBut the government has faced criticism for its response\\n\\nThe prime minister - a keen supporter of the country\\'s coal industry - has faced fierce criticism over his apparent failure to anticipate the crisis, his slow response to the disaster and his reluctance to accept a link between the bushfires and climate change.\\n\\nImage copyright Getty Images\\n\\nMr Morrison was forced to apologise for going on a family holiday to Hawaii last month as the crisis escalated and he has been heckled by locals in NSW and Victoria.\\n\\nIn response, the Australian leader has expressed regret over his handling of the crisis and said he would seek a royal commission review - a type of public inquiry - into the country\\'s response. He has also promised A$2bn ($1.4bn; £1.1bn) in aid to help the country recover\\n\\nBut the prime minister is being urged to do more to cut Australia\\'s carbon emissions and tackle climate change, which is seeing the country\\'s average temperatures rise.\\n\\nTens of thousands of people across Australia took part in climate change protests last week.\\n\\nThe latest figures from Australia\\'s Bureau of Meteorology show 2019 was the country\\'s hottest and driest year on record.\\n\\nThe conditions were caused by a climate phenomenon called a positive Indian Ocean Dipole (IOD), which was unusually strong, a rare Sudden Stratospheric Warming event, which pushed weather systems northward, as well as climate change, the bureau said.\\n\\nLast year\\'s annual mean temperature was 1.52 degrees Celsius above the 1961-1990 average of 21.8C - higher than the previous record of 1.33 degrees Celsius in 2013.\\n\\nAustralia\\'s state of the climate report, published last year, warned that warming temperatures meant there had been a \"long-term increase in extreme fire weather\" as well as an extension in the \"length of the fire season\".\\n\\nBut there have been warnings of Australia\\'s increased levels of fire risk since 1988 - and a 2007 report by Australia\\'s federal science agency predicted more intense fires would be seen by 2020, says Dr Tim Curran, senior lecturer in ecology at Lincoln University in New Zealand.\\n\\nThe scale and intensity of this year\\'s fires and the fact they are now more likely to become a common phenomenon means the Australian authorities may well have to take further steps to prepare in future years.\\n\\nProfessor Dale Dominey-Howes, director of the Asia-Pacific Natural Hazards and Disaster Risk Research Group at the University of Sydney, argues the current bushfire crisis - and the fact it is affecting multiple states and territories simultaneously - represented a \"new normal\" and the government needed to act.\\n\\n\"We need new approaches to disaster management - a professional paid workforce, capable of round the clock, round the year and around the country deployment, capable of responding to multiple disaster types,\" he says.\\n  '},\n",

              "  'text': '\\n   Image copyright Getty Images\\n\\nAs Australia battles unprecedented fires this year, a debate is under way about what is called \"controlled burning\" as a means to stop fires spreading.\\n\\nThis involves deliberately starting fires under controlled conditions to clear out low-lying flammable material - sometimes called \"prescribed\" or \"hazard reduction burning\".\\n\\nIt is not the same as \"back burning\", which is done as a last resort to try to slow down an approaching wildfire by stripping the ground of vegetation.\\n\\nSome politicians in Australia have blamed environmental activism for stopping controlled fires because of their impact on wildlife and fauna.\\n\\nSo what is the truth behind these claims, and does controlled burning really work?\\n\\nWhat is being said about controlled burning?\\n\\nThe issue is part of a dispute between the Australian Greens and some other political parties.\\n\\nThe Greens say the major parties need to do more to tackle climate change.\\n\\nOther politicians have hit back, such as National Party MP Barnaby Joyce who has pointed to what he says is the Greens\\' opposition to controlled burning.\\n\\nHe thinks the practice should happen more frequently to stop wildfires, and that you need to burn off flammable vegetation otherwise you increase the risk of fires spreading.\\n\\nGetty It’s not burning because they burnt off - it’s burning because they didn’t burn off.\\n\\nPrime Minister Scott Morrison has said those \"who say they want action on climate change\" could be \"the same people who don\\'t share the same urgency of dealing with hazard reduction\".\\n\\nBut the Australian Greens - who are not in the government at either national or state level - have made clear they support controlled burning if it is carried out under expert guidance.\\n\\nThe Greens told the BBC that these accusations have been made for some years.\\n\\n\"We\\'ve never done anything to prevent or even restrict hazard reduction burning,\" they said.\\n\\nDoes controlled burning work?\\n\\nDone properly, it can help limit the spread of fires and make it easier to put them out.\\n\\nBut Swansea University professor Stefan Doerr, an expert in wildfires, believes the practice is less effective than it used to be because of the more extreme weather Australia has started to experience.\\n\\n\"It can make a difference for a few years, but I\\'m doubtful it would make a difference in the current extreme drought conditions,\" he said.\\n\\nImage copyright Getty Images Image caption This year\\'s fires have been particularly hot and intense\\n\\nHe adds that a particular feature of the recent fires in Australia is that they have spread across the crown or top part of the forest - so removing growth at ground level does not make that much difference.\\n\\nAlso the fires have been hot and intense enough to burn through areas that were already burned, with embers able to travel through the air and ignite areas far away from an active fire.\\n\\nHow much controlled burning has there been?\\n\\nAustralian firefighters have a long history of carrying out this type of burning to reduce fire risk. \"They are some of the most experienced and well-trained in the world,\" says Prof Doerr.\\n\\nBurning to prevent fires is regulated and carried out by state agencies like the relevant fire service, park authority or environment body.\\n\\nIn areas of special environmental value or near heritage sites, national level permission is needed, according to the Department of the Environment and Energy.\\n\\nAn analysis by ABC News shows that while some controlled burning targets in Queensland and New South Wales have been met, others have not because the weather conditions were not right.\\n\\nThe NSW Rural Fire Service report for 2018-19 reveals that although they exceeded targets for reducing fire hazards in parks and forested areas, they fell short of their targets for local government land, privately-owned land and other areas.\\n\\nGetty Prolonged drought conditions adversely affected the ability to complete hazard reduction work.\\n\\nControlled burning can only be done in cooler, damper weather with low wind speeds, to avoid the fire getting out of control.\\n\\nIn 2015, a fire that was started by the Victoria state authorities to burn off hazardous undergrowth ran out of control, destroying four homes and more than 3,000 hectares of farmland and forest.\\n\\nSome experts argue there needs to be a review of how money is spent dealing with fire risks in a hotter, drier climate.\\n\\nRod Keenan, of the University of Melbourne, who has called for a more integrated approach to land management, says: \"A lot of resources have gone into extra fire trucks, hoses and getting volunteers. We\\'re not putting sufficient resources into land management.\"\\n\\nSo while controlled burning does have its place, it is just one part of a broader strategy needed to combat the more extreme fires Australia now faces.\\n\\nRead more from Reality Check\\n\\nSend us your questions\\n\\nFollow us on Twitter\\n  '},\n",

This has created an evolutionary pressure for them to develop the ability to recover after being burnt, explained Dr Kimberley Simpson, a fire ecology expert at the University of Sheffield.\\n\\nPlants have evolved two ways of doing this.\\n\\nThe first is resprouting, which is clearly visible in the photographs, according to Dr Simpson.\\n\\nMany Australian tree species, including most Eucalyptus species, have epicormics buds, which are set deep beneath thick bark and are insulated from intense heat. Many shrubs and grasses are also protected by fire by insulating layer of soil, meaning they can resprout quickly.\\n\\nImage copyright Murray Lowe Image caption Some species have buds deeply buried in bark, insulating them from intense heat\\n\\nThe second way in which plant species recover quickly is through regeneration from heat-resistant seeds.\\n\\nIn fact, growth conditions are optimal after a fire for small seedlings, due to ample light and nutrients released from ash. Dr Simpson explained that it is \"common to see a rapid greening of the ground after fire\".\\n\\nHowever, there is no evidence of this process in Mr Lowe\\'s photographs, said Dr Simpson, because these seeds need rain to germinate and there has no been no rain in Kulnara since the fires.\\n\\nWill this happen all over fire-hit Australia?\\n\\nRegeneration after fire occurs over years - some species resprout soon after fire, and others take longer.\\n\\nMedia playback is unsupported on your device Media caption The orphaned Australian baby bats wrapped with love\\n\\nHowever, the size and severity of this season\\'s fires \"raise concerns about the survival of species that are adapted to fire\", said Dr Simpson.\\n\\nShe said the high temperatures the fires are reaching, combined with the unprecedented drought in many parts of Australia, are likely to cause high plant mortality.\\n\\n\"We may see local extinctions in cases where species are pushed beyond their ability to recover,\" she suggested.\\n\\nParticularly concerning is the impact of fire in Australia\\'s rainforests, which don\\'t normally experience fire, and are poorly equipped to recover after being burned.\\n  '},\n",

              "  'text': '\\n   Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Aboriginal people have long used techniques to manage fires\\n\\nFor thousands of years, the Indigenous people of Australia set fire to the land.\\n\\nLong before Australia was invaded and colonised by Europeans, fire management techniques - known as \"cultural burns\" - were being practised.\\n\\nThe cool-burning, knee-high blazes were designed to happen continuously and across the landscape.\\n\\nThe fires burn up fuel like kindling and leaf detritus, meaning a natural bushfire has less to devour.\\n\\nSince Australia\\'s fire crisis began last year, calls for better reintegration of this technique have grown louder. But it should have happened sooner, argues one Aboriginal knowledge expert.\\n\\n\"The bush needs to burn,\" says Shannon Foster.\\n\\nShe\\'s a knowledge keeper for the D\\'harawal people - relaying information passed on by her elders - and an Aboriginal Knowledge lecturer at the University of Technology Sydney (UTS).\\n\\nMuch of the ancestral information she shares relates to the bush, says Ms Foster.\\n\\n\"It\\'s the concept of maintaining country - central to everything we do as Aboriginal people. It\\'s about what we can give back to country; not just what we can take from it.\"\\n\\n\\'Naive\\' techniques of today\\n\\nCountry is personified within Aboriginal culture. \"The earth is our mother. She keeps us alive,\" Ms Foster says. This relationship shifts priorities around precautionary burning.\\n\\nWhile modern-day authorities do carry out hazard reduction burning, focusing on protecting lives and property, Ms Foster says it\\'s \"clearly not working\".\\n\\n\"The current controlled burns destroy everything. It\\'s a naive way to practise fire management, and it isn\\'t hearing the Indigenous people who know the land best.\\n\\n\"Whereas cultural burning protects the environment holistically. We\\'re interested in looking after country, over property and assets.\\n\\n\"We can\\'t eat, drink or breathe assets. Without country, we have nothing.\"\\n\\nImage copyright Catherine McLachlan Image caption Shannon Foster relays techniques passed on by her D\\'harawal elders\\n\\nImage copyright UTS Image caption Her great-grandfather Tom (left) and grandfather Fred (third from left) give lessons in the 1940s\\n\\nIndigenous cultural burns work within the rhythms of the environment, attracting marsupials and mammals which Aboriginal people could hunt.\\n\\n\"Cool burning replenishes the earth and enhances biodiversity - the ash fertilises and the potassium encourages flowering. It\\'s a complex cycle based on cultural, spiritual and scientific knowledge.\"\\n\\nThey also create a mosaic of ecologies, Ms Foster says, and this can lead to beneficial micro-climates.\\n\\n\"Soft burning encourages rain - it warms the environment to a particular atmospheric level, and once the warm and the cool meet, condensation - rain - occurs, helping mitigate fires.\"\\n\\nHer Aboriginal elders in Sydney have been assessing the overgrown bush and extremely dry kindling for some time, warning that a huge fire is coming: \"They compared it to a kid with unkempt hair, saying it needs nurturing.\"\\n\\nBut local authorities have forbidden them from cultural burning when they\\'ve asked for permission.\\n\\nWhere cultural burning is used\\n\\nThere\\'s no one-size-fits-all approach to precautionary burning because the Australian landscape is so diverse from place to place.\\n\\nNonetheless, some states do integrate cultural burning with other strategies, according to Dr Richard Thornton, CEO of the Bushfire and Natural Hazards Cooperative Research Centre.\\n\\n\"There\\'s a stark difference in northern Australia, where Indigenous cultural burning happens substantially. In southern states, it\\'s sometimes done according to the needs and wishes of local communities.\"\\n\\nImage copyright AFP/Getty Images Image caption The bushfire crisis has devastated Australia since September\\n\\nSince Australia was colonised in 1788, cultural burning was slowly eradicated. But recent years have seen moves to reintegrate it.\\n\\nAssociate Prof Noel Preece, a former national parks ranger, wrote the first fire manual for central Australian park reserves.\\n\\nHe says cultural burning is still practised in parts of Melbourne, but largely stopped in south-eastern Australia because vegetation built up in \"precarious areas\" where cool burns don\\'t work.\\n\\n\"That said, Indigenous people had extremely detailed knowledge of \\'dirty country\\' that needs a good burn,\" says Associate Prof Preece, now of James Cook University.\\n\\nDrawbacks of the ancient practice\\n\\nCultural burning, Prof Preece says, can reduce fuel on the ground from 10 tons to 1 ton. But it\\'s only effective protection for moderate fires, so it needs to be done in conjunction with hazard reduction burns.\\n\\nEven then, it only reduces hazards: \"With the recent catastrophic conditions of humidity and high winds, nothing could stop these fires.\"\\n\\n\"Aboriginal people were taken off their country so there\\'s a re-learning process which is very useful and important. But it\\'s still early days and by itself, it\\'s not enough,\" he says.\\n\\nMedia playback is unsupported on your device Media caption The orphaned Australian baby bats wrapped with love\\n\\nExperts agree that cultural burning has limitations, partly because colonisation led to development and human-created climate change, presenting us with a very different landscape now to hundreds of years ago.\\n\\nProf Preece has been in areas where, day after day, the conditions for cooler cultural burning weren\\'t right.\\n\\n\"It\\'d be too moist, too cool, too hot, too dry - you have a narrow window. And with many firefighters in Australia being volunteers, they\\'re working during the week, and you could go four Saturdays till the conditions are right.\"\\n\\nFor thicker shrub running up tree canopies, he says a hot burn is required because cool burns won\\'t get rid of such layers of fuel.\\n\\nMedia playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Social media claims that arson was a significant factor in the fires have proved inaccurate\\n\\nIn addition, Dr Thornton says individual Indigenous burns, undertaken by specific agencies such as Firesticks, absolutely have their place, but need to fit within community expectations if done on a larger scale by others.\\n\\n\"We need to ensure fire doesn\\'t escape and burn down somebody\\'s property. It\\'d undermine community views of the entire practice so we need to ensure we operate within a safety framework which is defendable.\"\\n\\nThe way forward\\n\\nPrime Minister Scott Morrison has promised a \"comprehensive\" inquiry into the ongoing bushfire crisis which has so far killed 27 people and scorched more than 10 million hectares.\\n\\nWhen it goes ahead, Dr Thornton stresses the need to \"talk to Indigenous elders in each different area and listen\".\\n\\nBut he says not a single Indigenous person sits on the board of the national bushfire research centre he manages.\\n\\nShannon Foster is keen to work together with government agencies, but she worries about expanding development: \"It terrifies me that so much land has been decimated, developers could move in and say we might as well put this estate here; the land is cleared.\"\\n\\n\"Aboriginal people have looked after this place for so long - to see it now destroyed because nobody has allowed us to care for it is devastating,\" she adds.\\n\\n\"It\\'s not like we didn\\'t tell you so.\"\\n  '},\n",

Stuffed with jargon and seriously lacking in inspirational clipart, they provide important clues about how things might play out.\\n\\nWhy PD is key\\n\\nRemember the Political Declaration? Known in Brussels as \"the PD\", it\\'s the 26-page sketch of the future relationship agreed alongside the 600-page Withdrawal Agreement, which settled the terms of the UK\\'s departure.\\n\\nImage copyright Getty Images Image caption The UK officially leaves the European Union on 31 January 2020\\n\\nThe Political Declaration is often seen as a lesser document because it isn\\'t legally binding, or as a sweetener to make the divorce terms more palatable.\\n\\nIt\\'s clear that the EU takes the document as gospel because it\\'s quoted at length in the slides. At length. Like it\\'s the law.\\n\\nEU officials are alert for signs that the UK might be softening on commitments made in the PD.\\n\\nIt\\'s also a handy tool for keeping EU member states in line. For example, some have asked for other things to be added, to be told it\\'s now too late.\\n\\nSo it\\'s worth re-reading.\\n\\nFTA, you say?\\n\\nOne of the sessions for diplomats was about the centrepiece of the new relationship with the UK - the Free Trade Agreement (FTA).\\n\\nThis presentation was full of the EU\\'s usual catch-phrases about this stuff: being out can\\'t be as good as being in, there\\'s no way to replicate membership of the single market without the free movement of people, etc etc.\\n\\nMedia playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Barclay: \\'Let\\'s be positive\\' about 2020 Brexit trade deal deadline\\n\\nIn the Theresa May era, this would read like a comprehensive rejection by Brussels of requests made by the UK.\\n\\nIt doesn\\'t feel that way, now that there\\'s a new British government which is relaxed about a looser economic relationship and can live with some friction in its trade with the EU.\\n\\nBut the EU thinks the UK still has to be reminded about what it can and can\\'t get.\\n\\nAnd the message on financial services in the slides is unambiguous: \"not subject to negotiation.\"\\n\\nThat\\'s because both sides will use existing ways of monitoring each other\\'s regulations rather than inventing new ones.\\n\\nA field with no ref, that\\'s the LPF\\n\\nGet used to another acronym - the LPF, or Level Playing Field.\\n\\nThis is a series of measures to manage economic competition with the UK, which the EU says is necessary to reduce the risk of it being undercut by British firms that benefit from the new free trade agreement.\\n\\nImage copyright Getty Images Image caption Irish Prime Minister Leo Varadkar said a level playing field was needed to ensure the single market and customs union were \"not diluted\"\\n\\nThe EU intends that the level playing field will cover taxation, labour relations and environmental policies, and government support for companies, known as \"state aid.\"\\n\\nThe main tool will be a promise not to fall below current shared standards known as the non-regression clause.\\n\\nBut the EU has introduced an extra concept via the slides - \"non-lowering\".\\n\\nAt first this sounds the same as non-regression but it means that if one party raises standards then there\\'s a possibility they may never be allowed to be lowered again. This goes beyond merely maintaining existing standards.\\n\\nAnd the EU wants the UK to stay in lock-step with European policies on the environment and state aid as they develop.\\n\\nIt\\'s described in the presentations to diplomats as an \"ambition to improve over time\", but in negotiating parlance is called \"dynamic alignment\".\\n\\nThis is a massive no-no for the British government and will likely cause a big row.\\n\\nJointly committed\\n\\nThe EU negotiators think this will all have to be managed and they place great importance on an \"overarching governance framework\", part of which would be a joint committee of ministers and officials.\\n\\nAccording to the slides, one of its big tasks would be deciding how to apply new EU laws or initiatives that didn\\'t exist when the deal was negotiated.\\n\\nAnother would be working out what to do when one side or the other diverged from where things started.\\n\\nAt the same time, the EU would develop its own tools to retaliate quickly if the UK did something deemed unacceptable.\\n\\nThis is at the heart of the deal the EU agreed with Switzerland (but which hasn\\'t been approved yet) and my hunch is it\\'ll be at the heart of what\\'s negotiated with the UK.\\n\\nDon\\'t forget the fish\\n\\nAnd finally, who could forget what access the EU will get to UK waters to catch fish, and British access to the EU market to sell it, billed as the biggest flashpoint?\\n\\nThe slides reiterate that a deal on trade is contingent on a deal on fish. What\\'s not clear is how the two will be linked - either in the negotiation process or in the final agreements.\\n\\nImage copyright Getty Images Image caption The UK will have to decide if it is going to allow access by foreign vessels to its fishing waters\\n\\nThe EU says it will look at \"socio-economic\" factors - the real-world effect on fishing communities. That might be surprising if you think this should be a purely technical, environmental matter, but it reflects the importance of the sector in the European psyche.\\n\\nAnother key phrase is \"relative stability\". This is code for agreeing the broad outlines of how many fish can be caught over a long period of time, maybe decades. It means there might not be much to decide in annual fishing negotiations between the UK and the EU.\\n\\nThere are more presentations and a lot of details still to come.

The long-serving Dmitry Medvedev has been replaced by a man most people had never heard of, until now.\\n\\nNot only that, President Vladimir Putin has initiated a major reform of the constitution that looks like the start of his \"transition\": a much-anticipated plan to retain influence when he has to leave the Kremlin in 2024.\\n\\nThe details of that plan are still unclear, but this week\\'s surprise shake-up offers curious new hints.\\n\\nWhy did the prime minister have to go?\\n\\nMr Medvedev\\'s departure was a shock - or at the least, the timing of it.

Now he\\'s taking the rap for Russia\\'s economic problems.\\n\\nThe patriotic \"blip\" over the 2014 annexation of Crimea has faded, and for many families there\\'s no replacement balm for the harsh realities of life. Mr Putin\\'s state of the nation speech this year recognised that, focusing heavily on welfare instead of sabre-rattling at the West.\\n\\nSo he\\'s brought in a new man to sort out the economy, and state TV has been pumping out positive messages.

Mr Putin has explained it as bringing power closer to the people: MPs will get more say in forming the government, for example.\\n\\nHe argues it\\'s more democratic, and will be more effective.\\n\\nBut most commentators see that as masking another agenda: Vladimir Putin carving out a suitable role for when he has to pack up and leave the Kremlin.

              "  'text': '\\n   Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Though Prohibition was repealed in 1933, alcohol remains controversial in the US\\n\\nIt is 100 years to the day since Prohibition came into effect. The 18th Amendment to the Constitution banned anyone in the US from selling, making, importing or even transporting alcohol.\\n\\nCriminal gangs immediately took over the industry. Speakeasies sprung up nationwide to sell illegal liquor and tens of millions flouted the legislation.\\n\\nBy 1933 it had been repealed - the only instance when a constitutional amendment has been overturned in this way.\\n\\nProhibition is now viewed as a failure. No major political parties or organisations support its return, and there is little public support for such an extreme response in the future.\\n\\nBut alcohol remains controversial in the US. The drinking age of 21 is higher than in other nations where drinking is legal. Dry counties and dry towns - where alcohol sales are restricted or barred outright - are dotted throughout the country. And Gallup polling from last year shows that nearly one fifth of respondents said drinking alcohol was \"morally wrong\".\\n\\nA century on, a small group of Americans are fighting to keep the dream of the so-called \"noble experiment\" alive.\\n\\n\"You should think of the Prohibition Party as an exercise in living history,\" says Jim Hedges, treasurer to the party, which is the third-oldest in the US.\\n\\n\"We\\'re trying to keep the concept alive and the history alive,\" he tells the BBC. \"But as far as getting big enough to have influence, it\\'s not going to happen any time soon.\"\\n\\nThe US temperance movement, which sought to control or even ban alcohol sales, developed through the 19th Century. Campaigners focused on the perceived immorality of drinking as well as the health effects. Religious groups like Methodists and later organisations like the Anti-Saloon League helped bring about the law change.\\n\\nDr Julia Guarneri, senior lecturer in US history at the University of Cambridge, tells the BBC that women\\'s groups - in particular the Woman\\'s Christian Temperance Union (WCTU) - were vital in bringing about prohibition.\\n\\n\"They thought alcohol was one way that money went from the employer to the employee to the saloon, and never reached the family,\" Dr Guarneri says. Women and children were also victims of abuse from alcoholic husbands and fathers.\\n\\nImage copyright Getty Images Image caption Women\\'s groups across the country - like the women of Madison, Minnesota - fought for prohibition\\n\\nAs reformers pushed for women\\'s right to vote - ratified in the 19th Amendment, which was officially adopted just eight months after Prohibition took effect - women activists also sought to ban alcohol, seeing it as another way that women were oppressed in society.\\n\\n\"There\\'s more of a connect between those two pieces of legislation than you might think,\" Dr Guarneri says. \"The WCTU saw the banning of alcohol as a way both to keep families happier and healthier, and women happier and healthier.\"\\n\\nWorries about the large numbers of immigrants coming to US shores at the end of the 19th and early 20th Centuries - in particular Catholics and Jews travelling from southern and eastern Europe - were another factor.\\n\\nSome European Catholics in particular brought a beer-drinking culture to the US which was alien to its Protestant populations. But on top of this, both Catholics and Jews incorporate alcohol in their religious rituals. While these ceremonies were still allowed during prohibition, Dr Guarneri says that alcohol \"became a way to police and oppress those immigrant populations\".\\n\\nThe start of World War I further helped the temperance movement. Campaigners won support arguing that grains should be used for food rather than for beer during the conflict, while German immigrants or their descendants owned many of the breweries.\\n\\n\"So it was very easy to paint a portrait of alcohol being un-American,\" Dr Guarneri says. \"You name it - Pabst, Schlitz, Budweiser... there wasn\\'t going to be a lot of public sympathy for the owners of the breweries from the US.\"\\n\\nBut Prohibition was widely flouted. Many Americans, particularly the wealthy and the privileged, dodged the law with ease. President Warren Harding is said to have openly served alcohol confiscated by his government at the White House.\\n\\nImage copyright Getty Images Image caption Alcohol proved to be more popular than temperance campaigners believed\\n\\nThe law grew more and more unpopular. Politicians also missed the tax revenue from alcohol sales after the Wall Street Crash of 1929. Franklin Roosevelt promised to repeal the measure in his bid for the presidency in 1932, and within a year of him coming to office, national prohibition was dead.\\n\\nSarah Ward, former president of the WCTU, tells the BBC that Prohibition \"probably did our organisation more harm than good after the repeal\".\\n\\nTo join the WCTU, applicants must pledge to avoid alcohol and pay membership dues. Ms Ward signed up as a teenager in the 1950s, and has kept that pledge to this day.\\n\\nShe spent decades teaching people about the health impact of alcohol, and says she is proud of that work. But she said the current state of the temperance movement in the US was \"very discouraging\".\\n\\n\"We can always hope that somebody will realise and a corner will be turned and that\\'ll be great if it happens,\" Ms Ward says - although she thinks members of the WCTU are \"more realistic\" now.\\n\\n\"Today, as far as Prohibition is concerned, we will have that when each individual makes the choice that that is the best way for them to live,\" she said. \"We can\\'t get restrictions on anything.

The officials are apparently worried that the Chinese-made drones could be used to spy on people in the US.\\n\\nAfter a volcano exploded in Hawaii in May 2018, US scientists used drones to save a man from the lava: \"Follow the drone,\" they said. He made it through the jungle.\\n\\nDrones save people. They also map terrain, survey land and inspect pipelines. The scientists use drones for these and other purposes on a daily basis, and they have bragged about their successes in the field.\\n\\nMany of the aircraft are made by Chinese companies, though. They are now grounded because of concerns about espionage.\\n\\nThe drones had been deployed for years by the scientists and others at the US Department of the Interior, a federal agency that manages national parks and other duties. But the head of the federal agency, David Bernhardt, is apparently now worried that the drones could be used for espionage.\\n\\nHe is examining the agency\\'s civilian drone programme in an effort to determine whether or not it should be continued. During this time, many of the drones are grounded, according to an agency spokeswoman, Melissa Brown. \"Until this review is completed, the secretary has directed that drones manufactured in China or made from Chinese components be grounded,\" according to a statement she sent to the BBC.\\n\\nDrones that are used to fight fires and help rescue people are still allowed to fly, she added. News of the fleet\\'s grounding was first reported in the Financial Times.\\n\\nImage copyright Getty Images Image caption Drones such as this one, an aircraft flown in Los Angeles, look for forest fires\\n\\nMr Bernhardt\\'s review of the drone programme reflects a growing concern among US officials about Chinese technology and espionage.\\n\\nPresident Donald Trump has spoken in dark terms about China, saying that its leaders have \"cheated\" the US and that its intelligence agents spy on people here. Chinese officials deny the accusations. Despite the rhetoric, US-China relations have improved.\\n\\nOn Wednesday, Trump is planning to sign an initial trade deal with Chinese leaders. Still, fundamental issues remain, such as the fight over technology. US officials have said in the past that Huawei, the telecommunications company, and other Chinese companies could pose a security threat.\\n\\nSome Chinese analysts say the fight is not over national security but market share. The Chinese are better at making products, they say, and Americans are jealous. The Chinese analysts see the US policies as a form of protectionism.\\n\\nImage copyright Getty Images Image caption Chinese-made drones, an array that includes these models shown in Guangzhou, have sparked controversy in the US\\n\\nThe drones are now at the centre of the US-China dispute.\\n\\nMany of the drones that are used by US scientists are made by a Shenzhen-based company called Da Jiang Innovations Science and Technology Company, or, DJI. The company dominates the drone market, according to a research company, Skylogic.\\n\\nUS officials have in the past expressed concerns about DJI. Agents at a US immigration office said in 2017 that the company\\'s drones could collect information about US sites and transmit data back to Beijing.\\n\\nRules and norms are different for private companies in China than they are in the US. Business executives in China stay in close contact with government officials. US officials worry about the information that Chinese drones could collect and what might be done with the data.\\n\\nThe Chinese executives could pass the data on to Beijing officials, explains Sarah Cook, a senior analyst with Freedom House, a non-profit organisation.\\n\\nImage copyright Getty Images Image caption Drones made by a Chinese company, DJI, are under suspicion in the US\\n\\nExecutives who work for DJI say their drones are trustworthy. Michael Oldenburg, a spokesman for DJI Technology Inc, tells the BBC there is no \"credible evidence to support a broad country-of-origin restriction on drone technology\".\\n\\nMany US analysts agree with Oldenburg\\'s assessment. \"I doubt the Chinese government is using the drones to conduct massive surveillance,\" says David Fidler, an adjunct senior fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations.\\n\\nFidler and others admit it is impossible to know how much information the drones are gathering, however. Analysts emphasise that the Chinese officials pose a threat to the US and that Chinese companies should be banned from certain kinds of work.\\n\\n\"I wouldn\\'t want a Chinese server operating our nuclear system,\" says Paul Rosenzweig, a senior fellow at the conservative R Street Institute who served as a US Department of Homeland Security official during the George W Bush White House years.\\n\\nYet Rosenzweig and others say that the drones seem benign. The aircraft fly over wildlife areas and parks and are unlikely to collect sensitive data. \"It is an acceptable risk,\" Rosenzweig says, adding: \"I don\\'t think drones covering Yosemite National Park are a real threat.\"\\n\\nThe real assessment, the one from the secretary of the interior, is yet to be announced, however. In the meantime, scientists and others wait - and wonder - about the fate of the drones.\\n  '},\n",

I actually don\\'t think it\\'s about the dollar figure, it\\'s a general view that people who have a lot of means and the capacity to pay for themselves should be doing it.\"\\n\\nThe duke and duchess themselves have not said they expect Canadians to pick up the tab, Mr Wudrick notes, and federal officials have admitted it\\'s not clear yet how costs may be divided - or what those costs would be.\\n\\nPrime Minister Justin Trudeau told broadcaster Global News this week that \"there\\'s still a lot of decisions to be taken by the Royal Family, by the Sussexes themselves as to what level of engagement they choose to have\".\\n\\nThe question of security costs is \"part of the reflection that needs to be had and there are discussions going on\", he said.\\n\\nSo while the Queen has agreed to the couple\\'s wish to step back as senior royals, become financially independent and to split their time between the UK and Canada, the details of the transition are still being worked out.\\n\\nMr Wudrick says that \"in the interests of settling everyone down - maybe this is all a tempest in a teapot - it would be helpful if the duke and duchess could provide some clarity on what their expectations are\".\\n\\nJohn Michaelson, with the Monarchist League of Canada, agrees answers should come sooner rather than later.\\n\\nMost Canadians don\\'t spend much time thinking about the Royal Family or their official role in Canada, he says, and the benefits of the institution are often hidden from view - the thousands of community, ceremonial, and constitutional engagements the family and the Queen\\'s representatives there carry out annually across the country.\\n\\nMedia playback is unsupported on your device Media caption \"Just leave them alone\" - How do Canadians feel about the Duke and Duchess of Sussex visiting?\\n\\nThe league have released regular reports on costs related to the Canadian Crown for the past 20 years \"to try and bring the point home that this is something that we get great benefit from and it doesn\\'t cost a great deal\", he said.\\n\\nThe tally is approximately C$1.68 ($1.29; £0.99) a year per Canadian for the general cost of the Crown, according to their most recent study.\\n\\nMr Michaelson says Prince Harry and Meghan\\'s relocation is also an opportunity for the pair to deepen their engagement with organisations like the Prince\\'s Trust Canada, a charitable endeavour established by Prince of Wales in 2011.\\n\\nMeanwhile, a columnist with the National Post newspaper said the debate over the likely negligible relative cost of protecting direct close relations to Canada\\'s head of state \"has revealed one of the ugliest elements of the Canadian national character\".\\n\\n\"It\\'s true, Canada.

The US Food and Drug Administration has long approved MSG for consumption, and studies have failed to show that the chemical causes the alleged \"syndrome\".\\n\\nWhat\\'s the science behind MSG?\\n\\nThe flavour enhancer works when molecules of MSG bind to receptors on the tongue that naturally sense the key flavour chemical it contains - glutamate.\\n\\nGlutamate is a compound naturally found in foods from breast milk to parmesan cheese.\\n\\nMSG was patented in 1909 by the Japanese chemist Kikunae Ikeda, who gave his invention the name \"the essence of taste\" and described its ineffable flavour as \"umami\", now recognised as one of the five basic flavours.\\n\\nAlthough anecdotal claims that MSG has adverse effects have proliferated since the mid-20th Century, no studies have established any accepted mechanism for harm.\\n\\nA 2019 review of scientific literature in the journal Food Science and Food Safety concluded that claims linking MSG to an assortment of ailments were unsubstantiated.\\n\\nWords and meanings\\n\\nThe comedian and chef Eddie Huang and the TV host Jeannie Mai were recruited to bolster the MSG\\'s cause.\\n\\n\"You know what gives me a headache? Racism,\" says Ms Mai.\\n\\nThe campaign theme fits within a larger movement to elevate ethnic foods, which chefs like Mr Huang have argued are unfairly seen as inferior to European fare.\\n\\nMerriam-Webster\\'s has said that it will consider revising \"Chinese restaurant syndrome\".\\n  '},\n",

This is the last, formal step the House takes before it hands over the impeachment proceedings to the Senate.\\n\\nIt took her some time - because she used a different pen for each stroke, joking: \"It makes a funny signature.\"\\n\\nReporters snapped photos of four trays, each holding eight pens engraved with Ms Pelosi\\'s name, before the signing ceremony.\\n\\nMedia playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Speaker Nancy Pelosi signed the articles of impeachment\\n\\nThis is actually a long-standing US tradition - since President Franklin Roosevelt, presidents have frequently used multiple pens to sign high-profile pieces of legislation, so they can be offered as souvenirs and historical keepsakes.\\n\\nPresident Donald Trump joked that he was running out of pens as he signed legislation on his inauguration day - while President Barack Obama used 22 pens to sign the Affordable Care Act into law.\\n\\nMs Pelosi has faced criticism for using several pens to sign the impeachment articles - with Republican critics saying she appeared to be celebrating what was supposed to be a sombre moment.\\n\\nHer office, however, argued that while impeachment is \"tragic... it is indisputably historic when the Constitution and its balance of power reasserts itself.\"\\n\\nBack in 1998, Republican senators also kept pens as souvenirs after signing oaths for the impeachment trial of President Bill Clinton - although those pens had typos on the text inscribed on them, and had to be reissued.\\n\\nAn impeachment walk - twice\\n\\nFollowing Wednesday\\'s signing, the House clerk walked across the Capitol, under the iconic Rotunda, to deliver the two articles of impeachment to the Senate.\\n\\nImage copyright AFP Image caption House clerk Cheryl Johnson and Sergeant of Arms Paul Irving led Wednesday\\'s procession\\n\\nShe was accompanied by the House Sergeant at Arms and the seven impeachment managers.\\n\\nIt was a rare moment when members of the House formally crossed over to the Senate - typically, the two chambers function separately.\\n\\nThe tradition of the procession is thought to go back to the impeachment of President Andrew Johnson in 1868. Lawmakers also made the same walk in 1998, when carrying articles impeaching President Bill Clinton.\\n\\n\"Ceremony and precedence play a role in strengthening the way in which legislative bodies function,\" Prof Richard Arenberg, an expert in Congressional history and procedures at Brown University, and a former Capitol Hill staffer, told the BBC.\\n\\nThe procession \"symbolises the transmission of the solemn document enacted by the House of Representatives, and acceptance of it by the Senate\".\\n\\nWhen the procession arrived at the Senate chamber, the House clerk informed the Senate that the House had passed a resolution appointing the impeachment managers, and the Senate President, Republican Charles E Grassley, replied \"the message will be received\".\\n\\nHouse Democrats had to make the walk again on Thursday, as Senate Majority leader Mitch McConnell asked them to return to formally exhibit the articles of impeachment then.\\n\\n\\'Hear ye hear ye\\'\\n\\nYou wouldn\\'t normally hear medieval English in the Senate.\\n\\nMedia playback is unsupported on your device Media caption ‘Hear ye, hear ye!’ Trump impeachment trial begins\\n\\nBut on Thursday, the sergeant of arms - Senate\\'s chief law enforcement officer - kicked off proceedings by announcing: \"Hear ye, hear ye, hear ye, all persons are commanded to keep silence, on pain of imprisonment, while the House of Representatives is exhibiting to the Senate of the United States articles of impeachment against Donald John Trump, president of the United States\".\\n\\nWhy did he sound so formal? Most of the words he used are actually set out in the Senate impeachment rules, which were developed in 1868 and last revised in 1986.\\n\\n\"This is only the third impeachment trial in US history - a lot of the procedures have come through two centuries, without routine use, so they may seem archaic,\" Prof Arenberg says.\\n\\nNonetheless, he adds, the traditions and ceremonies that have developed help underline the \"seriousness\" and \"sober gravity\" of what it taking place.\\n\\nSigning the oath book\\n\\nThe Senate impeachment rules also specify that when it is the president or vice-president who is being impeached, the Chief Justice of the Supreme Court should preside over the trial.\\n\\nChief Justice Roberts had to be formally sworn in, before administering oaths for all 100 senators, who also had to sign an oath book that is kept in the national archives.\\n\\nProf Arenberg says it is significant that they are required to take a separate oath.\\n\\n\"This is an additional oath above their oath of office - it\\'s to underline that this is different from the partisan and legislative procedures they normally go through. Even beyond the oath of the Constitution when they take office, they need to additionally swear to offer impartial justice in this trial.\"\\n\\nThe Senate then issued a formal summons to President Trump, informing him of the charges against him.\\n\\nThe trial is set to reconvene on Tuesday.\\n\\nWant to find out more?\\n  '},\n",

              "  'text': '\\n   Just outside the remote Russian village of Dargavs lies a medieval necropolis fittingly called the “City of the Dead”. This ancient burial ground holds the remains of more than 10,000 people – many of whom lie eternally with their clothes and belongings – and some locals believe that anyone who dares to enter won’t return alive. While much mystery surrounds this graveyard located just over the border from Georgia (even the date of its construction is still just an estimate) historians are gradually unravelling its full story.\\n\\nSince the 16th Century, this remote stretch of southern Russian farmland has been used as a burial ground; its origins, though, are still unclear. One theory is that when territory was scarce during the 13th-Century Mongol-Tatar invasion, locals living in this 17km valley of the Caucasus mountains began to create similarly structured above-ground crypts to conserve space. Another theory suggests that the City of the Dead was created following the Indo-Iranian tradition established by the migrating Sarmatians who settled in southern Russia and buried their dead above ground to respect the land.\\n\\nToday, the site comprises 99 remarkably conserved medieval curved-roof crypts with single windows, and contains more than 100 bodies. Some are so well preserved that flesh is still attached to their bones.\\n\\nThis media cannot be played on your device.\\n\\nThe City of the Dead’s story also incorporates another piece of the region’s history: a series of plague epidemics in the 17th and 18th Centuries. There is evidence that infected residents quarantined themselves in the crypts as they waited for death to approach. Some bodies inside the crypts are also buried inside wooden coffins that resemble boats, and one corpse was even discovered with an oar next to it. With no navigable rivers nearby, some historians think ancient residents believed that one must cross a river to reach heaven.\\n\\nWhile many visitors travel to this 1.5-hectare cemetery to see remarkably well-preserved medieval architecture, historian Luidmila Gaboeva believes they come away with something more. “The people who come here in awe of the beauty of this place achieve peace with the eternal fear of death,” she said.\\n\\n(Video by Ana González, text by Emily Cavanagh)\\n\\nThis video is part of BBC Reel’s Hidden Histories playlist.\\n\\nJoin more than three million BBC Travel fans by liking us on Facebook, or follow us on Twitter and Instagram.\\n\\nIf you liked this story, sign up for the weekly bbc.com features newsletter called \"The Essential List\".

It’s not because he couldn’t take more: he is in fact entitled to 20 days annual leave.\\n\\nInstead, like many Japanese workers, taking time off work beyond the absolute minimum is simply not an option. “It’s difficult because the atmosphere in the workplace wouldn't allow it,” says Hideyuki, who has two children, aged six and four, and is reluctant to give his full name due to potential repercussions at work.\\n\\n“I don’t want my manager to be saying anything bad about me because I took the day off.

              "  'text': '\\n   Known for doling out exercise tips and living by the ‘rise and grind’ mantra, fitness influencers on Instagram contribute significantly to the pressure many of us feel to present only our healthiest and most active selves on social media. The hashtag #fitspiration – a hybrid of ‘fitness’ and ‘inspiration’ – has been used nearly 18 million times on the platform by these influencers and their many millions of followers.\\n\\nYet while physical activity and balanced eating are certainly important, the dark side to fitness obsession can pose a serious danger to the people striving for perfection. Orthorexia nervosa, or addiction to ‘healthy’ eating and over-exercise, is a medical condition rising in prominence alongside the #fitspiration Instagram fad. Untreated, it can lead to malnutrition and mental health complications, and those in the long recovery process are vulnerable to frequent relapses.\\n\\nResearch from scientists at University College London in 2017 found that higher Instagram usage was associated with increased likelihood of developing orthorexia, especially among followers of the ‘healthy eating’ influencers.\\n\\n“Fitness shouldn’t mean having to work out every day or weighing your damn lettuce,” says Jen Brett, a recovering orthorexia survivor and fitness influencer.\\n\\nHear more from Brett in the video above, and learn about the warning signs of over-exercise rampant on Instagram.\\n\\nThis video originally appeared in BBC Reel’s Woker World, a series of deep dives into contemporary issues affecting the younger generation of today.\\n  '}]"

            "The US and China have finally - after almost two years of hostilities - signed a \"phase one\" deal. But it only covers the easier aspects of their difficult relationship, and only removes some of the tariffs.\n",
            "\n",
            "The biggest hurdles are still to come, and could stand in the way of a second phase agreement - one that would in theory remove all of the tariffs, bringing some much needed relief for the global economy, which is in the interests of all of us.\n",
            "\n",
            "What's not in the phase one deal tells us where the flashpoints are in the US-China relationship - and what could derail the second round of negotiations.\n",
            "\n",
            "So what didn't make it into the agreement?\n",
            "\n",
            "1. Industrial subsidies and 'Made in China 2025'\n",
            "\n",
            "The deal doesn't address Beijing's ambitious 'Made in China 2025' programme, which is designed to help Chinese companies excel and become world-class leaders in emerging technologies. It also doesn't address the subsidies that China gives its state-owned enterprises, says Paul Triolo of the Eurasia Group.\n",

            "Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption What is Beijing planning with its \"Made in China 2025\" programme?\n",
            "\n",
            "Washington sees \"Made in China 2025\" as a direct threat to its supremacy in tech, saying that Chinese companies have only caught up with American ones - at times outpacing them - because they get unfair and outsized assistance from the Chinese government in the form of subsidies.\n",
            "\n",
            "These were amongst the thorniest issues the Trump administration had with China, but they've been pushed to the phase two process Mr Triolo says, along with \"market access in sectors such as cloud services, cyber security and data governance issues\".\n",
            "\n",
            "Beijing maintains it doesn't unfairly subsidise these industries or companies, but the reality is China isn't going to give up dominance in these sectors so easily.\n",
            "\n",
            "2. Huawei\n",
            "\n",
            "The trade deal won't reduce US pressure on Huawei, the Chinese telecoms giant that has been caught in the crossfire of the trade war, with the US Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin saying the company isn't a \"chess piece\" in the negotiations.\n",
            "\n",
            "That will disappoint both Huawei and the Chinese government which have been furious over how Washington has linked the company's fate to the relationship between the US and China.\n",
            "\n",
            "The Chinese firm became a symbol of the US-China tech rivalry and Washington has been lobbying its allies - including the UK - to not use Huawei's 5G technology services in critical communications infrastructure, alleging it could be used by Beijing to spy on customers. Huawei has denied this and had hoped that if the US-China relationship improved, its fortunes would too.\n",
            "\n",
            "Analysts tell me that's unlikely. With the signing of this agreement, there's a clear separation between national security and trade, and Huawei and other Chinese companies should still expect the pressure on them to continue. So expect more American export bans not just on Huawei, but on several more Chinese companies and increased US scrutiny on Chinese investments abroad.\n",
            "\n",
            "3. Access for foreign financial services firms\n",
            "\n",
            "While the agreement does talk about opening up market access for financial services firms, some analysts have said it doesn't go far enough to ensure they have equal market access.\n",
            "\n",
            "China had already publicly said that it was opening up its financial services sector, and has recently allowed foreign companies to have a bigger stake in Chinese firms. But Beijing isn't giving up much by doing that, because China's financial services sector is now dominated by domestic digital payment players.\n",
            "\n",
            "Even if US payment firms do have greater market access to the Chinese market, it's hard to see how they might be able to compete. Whether China sincerely applies its commitments to treat foreign and domestic firms equally will also be watched closely by the Trump administration, and this could be a potential area where the rapprochement could be derailed.\n",
            "\n",
            "4. Enforcement and interpretation\n",
            "\n",
            "The deal has a dispute resolution mechanism in place, which basically requires China - once a complaint has been made - to begin consultations with the US, with the onus on Beijing to resolve it.\n",
            "\n",
            "But what the deal leaves out is \"how the US is going to monitor enforcement,\" says Derek Scissors of the American Enterprise Institute.\n",
            "\n",
            "\"American firms don't like to report intellectual property theft,\" he told me.\"So in the first instance what mechanism is the US using to gather information on this. All that is in the document is consultations.\"\n",

            "\n",
            "The deal also leaves out how the two sides will interpret these key aspects of the agreement. Already, there are signs of differences. Chinese state media has suggested the dispute resolution mechanism isn't dictated by the US - not entirely in keeping with Washington's messaging.\n",
            "\n",
            "This could indicate that even though there is an agreement in place, Beijing might ignore it, as Dan Harris of the China Law blog points out.\n",
            "\n",
            "\"The problem isn't the law,\" he says. \"It's that when something is important to China - some cutting edge technology that it wants - then those laws don't have any use at all.\"\n",

            "\n",
            "The deal doesn't include a definitive timeline on when the tariffs that are still in place will go down.\n",
            "\n",
            "According to research from the Peterson Institute for International Economics, average tariffs on both sides are still up about 20% from pre-trade war levels - six times higher than when the dispute began. That means companies and consumers are still paying more.\n",

            "\n",
            "Admittedly, the Trump administration has left the threat of tariffs in place as a stick to beat China with - in case Beijing doesn't keep to its commitments.\n",
            "\n",
            "And there's always that risk, as China's hard line Communist Party mouth-piece the Global Times points out: \"Can a preliminary trade agreement, reached during a period when China-US strategic relations are clearly declining, really work? Will it be replaced by new conflicts or further progress as negotiations continue?\"\n",

            "There is a widely-reported estimate that almost half a billion (480 million) animals have been killed by the bush fires in Australia.\n",
            "\n",
            "It's a figure that came from Prof Chris Dickman, an expert on Australian biodiversity at the University of Sydney.\n",
            "\n",
            "He released a statement explaining how he had reached the figure - a statement which refers to the number of animals affected rather than those necessarily dying as a direct result of the fire (although the title of the release talks about 480 million being killed).\n",
            "\n",
            "The numbers are based on a report he co-wrote in 2007 for the World Wide Fund for Nature (WWF) on the impact of land-clearing on Australian wildlife in New South Wales.\n",
            "\n",
            "It estimated that there were an average of 17.5 mammals, 20.7 birds and 129.5 reptiles per hectare (10,000 square metres, so a square 100m on each side - about the size of a rugby pitch).\n",
            "\n",
            "They've then multiplied that by the amount of land hit by the fires.\n",
            "\n",
            "\"We've estimated that in the three million hectares of New South Wales alone that were burned up until about 10 days ago probably as many as 480 million mammals, birds and reptiles would have been affected by the fires,\" Prof Dickman said.\n",

            "\n",
            "\"Certainly, large animals, like kangaroos or emus - many birds, of course - will be able to move away from the fire as it approaches,\" he told BBC Breakfast.\n",
            "\n",
            "\"I guess it's the less mobile species and the smaller ones that depend on the forest itself that are really in the firing line.\"\n",
            "\n",
            "But he added that many of those that survived the actual fire would die later because of lack of food or shelter.\n",
            "\n",
            "Colin Beale, an ecologist from University of York told Reality Check that may have been overstated.\n",
            "\n",
            "He said: \"In the areas of Africa where I work I am quite sure that very few birds die as a direct result of fire. They certainly have the ability to fly away from fires, and this is surely the case in Australia, too.\"\n",

            "\n",
            "There are a few caveats with these figures. First of all, the estimate is for damage only in New South Wales, and the fires have spread to Victoria.\n",
            "\n",
            "Also, the three million hectares figure is somewhat out of date - the fires have spread since then. So it is likely that more animals have been affected than the estimate suggests.\n",
            "\n",
            "But it is important to remember that this is just an estimate - its authors say the numbers are deliberately conservative. The figure for the number of reptiles is particularly uncertain, and reptiles make up three-quarters of the animals affected in these calculations.\n",
            "\n",
            "\"Density estimates are not available for many species, so they have had to be estimated from known densities of other species,\" Tom Oliver, professor of applied ecology at University of Reading, told Reality Check.\n",
            "\n",
            "\"For reptiles, there are no density estimates of individual species at all, just an estimate from a single study (Ehmann and Cogger 1985), which estimates 10 individuals per species per hectare.\"\n",
            "\n",
            "Colin Beale added: \"Although it is hard to find estimates of how well reptiles survive fires, in similar areas of Australia the majority of these reptiles live in the soil.\"\n",
            "\n",
