   At the ripe old age of 100, Dr Dolittle has been reincarnated in the form of Robert Downey Jr. In the latest screen version of the children’s literature classic, Dolittle, released in the US today, he is also Welsh… or at least Wales-adjacent. Because whilst he’s still able to talk to the animals, it would appear that Dr Dolittle is not so proficient in his new native voice.

More like this:

- The brilliant women the Oscars ignored

- What makes a Hollywood heartthrob?

- Will the Star Wars universe survive?

There was tantalisingly (and tellingly) little of Downey Jr speaking in the film’s trailer but just enough to threaten a film already beset by production issues – a title change, reshoots, and a postponed release date – with the heavy burden of an infamously bad accent. And now reviews have confirmed that his pronunciation is wayward, to say the least, with Vulture’s Bilge Ebiri describing it as “an ill-advised and half-hearted Welsh accent which occasionally (and I’m assuming inadvertently) slips into Irish, Indian and Jamaican intonations”.

The Dodgy Accent Hall of Fame (ruled over, of course, by Dick van Dyke) is a busy place. Echoing through its chambers are Russell Crowe’s not-very-Nottinghamshire Robin Hood, Anne Hathaway’s clunky ‘Yorkshire’ twang in One Day, Don Cheadle’s all-gone-Pete-Tong Cockney in the Ocean’s Eleven franchise, and rather too many non-native Bostonians from The Departed cast.

Recently, almost the entire cast of BBC gangster drama Peaky Blinders has been inducted. No other production seems to have generated quite the onslaught of accent-based anger as the Shelby family and their compatriots bringing cod-Brummie to the masses. Even the Scottish and Northern Irish characters have been called out for missing the mark.

Our new accent fixation

It seems like we’re more obsessed with analysing accents than ever before. Voice coach Erik Singer garners millions of views for his videos critiquing accents from Idris Elba to Daniel Day-Lewis to Cate Blanchett, while on the flip-side, there are some actors who assimilate so seamlessly, that the uproar comes when audiences hear them speak out of character. Killing Eve fans were shocked to hear Jodie Comer’s Liverpudlian accent in real-life after getting to know her as that show’s vocally chameleonic assassin Villanelle, who switches between Russian, French, Italian and German. And Christian Bale has played so many iconic roles using US accents – Patrick Bateman, Batman and Dick Cheney, to name a few – that audiences are often surprised to hear his own voice (he was born in Wales but grew up in England) when he gives interviews and awards speeches.

Also, when done right, putting on an accent definitely offers a little bump to your award-season chances, as demonstrated this year by the likes of Florence Pugh and Saoirse Ronan convincingly relocating their respective British and Irish accents to 19th-Century Massachusetts for Little Women, or native Aussie Margot Robbie turning American in Bombshell and Once Upon a Time… in Hollywood.

The key things to mastering an accent are courage, playfulness, a good ear, inventiveness, creativity and a real sensitivity – Joe Windley

For Rada lead voice tutor Joe Windley, the keys to mastering an accent successfully are “courage, playfulness, a good ear, inventiveness, creativity and a real sensitivity to the diverse range of sounds that can be used in any given speech system” (and for what it’s worth, Jodie Comer is top of his list of most vocally-skilled stars). Meanwhile the real challenge for actors is being “able to manifest the speech in such a way that it serves clarity and maintains authenticity”.

Classical acting training has traditionally focused on the voice being ‘whole’, meaning full of tone and fully articulate, but this is not how most people naturally speak. Recently, instead, there has been a contrasting obsession with authenticity, even though the specificity of an accent might only be noticeable to the community from which it comes. For example if the accents in Peaky Blinders sounded lightweight to locals, in the US they have proved convincingly alien enough that viewers have been switching on the subtitles. And trying to determine an ‘authentic’ accent for any particular country or region is not clear-cut: even when we speak in our own accent, it can vary significantly, as we code-switch depending on what context or to whom we are speaking.

A truly bad accent has always had the capacity to derail a production, yanking audiences out of the moment as it becomes impossible to look – or should that be listen – past. But, more than that, dodgy accents can also be morally problematic, serving to reinforce stereotypes, as explored in Hari Kondabolu’s 2017 documentary The Problem With Apu.

The days when English-speaking actors put on accents and told the world they were Russian or German or Swedish or Italian – those days are gone – Ralph Fiennes

The film looks at the Simpsons character of Apu Nahasapeemapetilon: one of the best-known (and only) representations of a south Asian person on mainstream television, but voiced by white actor Hank Azaria with a deliberately comic exaggeration that has increasingly been called out as racist. The problem of south Asian vocal caricaturing is also highlighted in Aziz Ansari’s Netflix comedy Master of None which features an episode titled Indians on TV, and deals with south Asian actors being asked to do stereotypical ‘Indian’ accents at auditions.

No more ‘funny voices’

Accents are absolutely part of the wider debate about representation in film and TV. The idea of an accent, particularly one of a different nationality to the actor, being just a ‘funny voice’ is increasingly unacceptable. When Ralph Fiennes was promoting The White Crow, his biopic of Rudolf Nureyev, he told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme of his decision to cast predominantly Russian actors: “I feel the days when English-speaking actors put on accents and told the world they were Russian or German or Swedish or Italian – those days are gone. One has read quite a lot of critical responses to films that are still doing that, where people go, ‘Haven’t we had enough?’ The landscape has shifted.”

Additionally, the deployment of accents can still be reflective of classism, and domination by the middle-and-upper classes. As actress Rebecca Humphries points out, for example, regional British accents are still sometimes used as a punchline. Humphries, who has worked at the Donmar Warehouse, National Theatre Company and the Royal Shakespeare Company, is originally from Norfolk, and is currently filming a project playing an extremely posh character, with a dialect coach on set. As a working-class person, she is conscious not to mock the accent, but says that in Shakespeare, it can be the opposite, when a broad, regional, working-class accent is frequently used for comedic roles. “It does my utter head in,” she says. “To make it ‘funny’. It’s because there’s a class snobbery there that the thicker [accent you have], the funnier you are.”

These days, actors have more reason to worry about getting their character’s chosen pronunciation right, however – for in 2020, film and television are not just available for consumption but for dissection. Screen-grabs and sound clips allow us to pore over performances for embarrassing mistakes, whether Quentin Tarantino’s misguided effort at Australian in Django Unchained (highlighting the perils of directing yourself) or Nicholas Cage’s Dolmio-esque Italian in Captain Corelli’s Mandolin.

What we found very quickly is that actors will act accents. They will not act, they will act accents – Craig Mazin

Hence the increasingly great lengths actors go to in order to nail an accent down. Scot Martin Compston stays in his London accent throughout the four months it takes to film a series of BBC cop drama Line of Duty. Booksmart actress Beanie Feldstein worked in a Wolverhampton shop to hone the Black Country accent necessary for her lead role in the upcoming film adaptation of Caitlin Moran’s best-selling novel How to Build a Girl. Meanwhile, for the forthcoming Ohio-set film Queen &amp; Slim, London-born Daniel Kaluuya worked at a Costco in Cleveland. As Humphries puts it: “The thing about theatre is that that performance is then gone. But on screen, that performance is around forever, and it’s within your interests not to f**k it up. People won’t forget it.”

However, with all the scrutiny applied to getting accents right these days, another option that has crept in very recently is to forgo the challenge by ignoring ‘authenticity’ completely, and have actors simply perform in their native intonation. Such was the case with last year’s critically-acclaimed HBO series Chernobyl, which told the story of the 1985 Soviet nuclear disaster with a largely British cast speaking in various different varieties of British accent. “What we found very quickly is that actors will act accents,” said creator and script-writer Craig Mazin explaining the decision. “They will not act, they will act accents, and we were losing everything about these people that we loved... My hope is that the accent thing just fades away in seconds, and you stop caring about it.”

What is ‘authentic’?

Such a creative strategy may seem to offer a ‘backlash’ against authenticity, but perhaps it’s more about the creators concentrating on being authentic to the essence of the story, rather than every tiny detail. Another example of this approach can be found in Armando Iannucci’s The Death of Stalin, where Soviet officials have accents from Brooklyn, Yorkshire and the East End. Humphries says that this option of abandoning accuracy is also becoming more common in theatre: “For a really long time, things needed to be quite rigid and firmly in place, and now there’s this real fluidity... If [the performance] is really good then the only people who are moaning about [accuracy] tend to be old-school purists and they’re just quite boring.”

You’ve got to pump yourself full of all this knowledge about how to stand, how to speak, so that once you’re on set, with any luck, it’ll be in your body and your voice – Rebecca Humphries

However if you are going to put a different voice on, in order to avoid Mazin’s concern of “acting accents”, Humphries says that the key is to get to a point of feeling physically at ease. “The idea being that you’ve got to pump yourself full of all this knowledge about how to stand, how to speak, so that once you’re on set, with any luck, it’ll be in your body and your voice so that you can do the acting and the reacting – the good stuff.”

But that process is a luxury rarely afforded to many shows, when time is short and performers have tight schedules as they move between jobs. Actor Charlie Allen explains that in theatre, there is often more of an opportunity to perfect an accent. “If you’re doing film and TV, you’re essentially kind of on your own before you turn up on set, and you’re not necessarily getting the feedback or guidance that you would do if you were in the theatre rehearsal room.”

Brighton-born Allen has direct experience of this, facing the same challenge as the Peaky Blinders cast recently when playing a Brummie character in new play, Skin in the Game by Paul Westwood. Even more dauntingly, one performance actually took place in a community centre at the foot of the Birmingham high-rise block of flats in which the play is set. In contrast to Peaky Blinders, though, the accents went down well: “I think I cheated a little bit because I actually have family from Birmingham,” Allen says. “Saying that, it’s one thing speaking to your family and speaking in your own natural rhythm [and another] when you’re picking up somebody’s play script and all of a sudden you have very specific things to say. And it was quite easy to tip over into Liverpudlian or Scouse, which we hadn’t even considered at all.”

To fudge or not to fudge?

However, although people might profess to crave authenticity, meticulous accuracy isn’t always helpful – or at least considered financially judicious. Often an accent can be historically accurate, while also being seen as alienating to a mass audience by the moneymen. For example, Chris Pine was mostly praised for his Scottish accent as Robert the Bruce in Netflix’s Outlaw King, but in real life, the 14th-Century Scotsman would probably have been speaking French. It isn’t surprising that producers decided to forgo the confusion that would inevitably have arisen from making him a Francophone.

Sometimes, either the producers or the actors themselves decide that a fudged accent, resting loosely in the vicinity of the correct pronunciation, might be the sweetest, and certainly the safest, spot for the widest possible audience to understand. The US Deep South is particularly at risk: Reese Witherspoon in Sweet Home Alabama, Julia Roberts in Charlie Wilson’s War and those of The Walking Dead cast who aren’t originally from Georgia have all been called out for being generically Southern, rather than specific to the states in which they’re set.

However Windley disagrees with such fudging. “If you’re going to set it in a particular place, you really are duty bound, I think, to find the authenticity of that place,” he says. “But that doesn’t mean to say you can only cast actors who come from there.” He prefers to talk about “speech systems” rather than accents or dialects, which he finds “problematic” terminology that fails to take in the diversity of human speech, or to acknowledge how voices are informed by age, gender, time and cultural context. The way we speak, he says, is “a living force. It’s not an external piece of clothing that you stick on from the outside”.

Accents are not just about the voice. The accent can make you hold your head differently – Ania Marson

He continues: “If you just study a speech system without fully exploring the context, and then you put it over the top of a situation, it will come over as phoney.” In short, getting an accent right is a lot more complicated, say, than simply shortening a few vowel sounds and calling everyone ‘duckie’. An accent needs to be embedded into the context of the story, rather than floating around on top of the performance, connected to nothing.

Actress Ania Marson agrees. She has been acting for almost six decades, most recently appearing in Killing Eve, The Alienist and Britannia. “Accents are not just about the voice,” she says. “The accent can make you hold your head differently. Your whole mouth changes in order to incorporate that, so there’s a kind of physicality that takes over which is fascinating. If you’re doing it in the right way, you sort of morph into a different person.”

There are some accents in film and TV history that are almost unanimously accepted as terrible, whether because they wander like the critically panned Keanu Reeves in Bram Stoker’s Dracula, whose attempt at a posh London accent does abominable things to vowels – or because the choice doesn’t ring true, like Angelina Jolie opting for a Russian-ish inflection despite Alexander’s Ancient Greek setting. Others are polarising: whether or not Robert Pattinson’s Monty-Python-esque take on the Dauphin in Netflix’s The King works probably depends on whether you thought his camply exaggerated French accent was hilarious or hideous.

But how we judge accents often comes down to a subjective decision about how important we think authenticity is in any particular instance. What is crucial is that we believe the stories we are watching, and that belief comes from somewhere considerably more inscrutable than what country, region or state a character sounds like they’re from.

However, considering all the potential risks that come with attempting an accent, it does seem worth asking the question, is it absolutely necessary to try putting one on in the first place? Dr Dolittle is not, of course, a real person, and authenticity is probably not the most important element in a story about talking animals. Having said that, given that Robert Downey Jr’s voice still seems to the least believable part of it, producers might be wishing that he’d stuck with his native New York tongue – or at least plumped for London, given his previous experience playing Sherlock Holmes.

Dolittle is released today in the US and 7 February in the UK and Ireland.

   At the south-eastern tip of Newfoundland, rugged cliffs rise imposingly above the sea. The craggy rocks are known as Mistaken Point, an homage to the many ships that met their untimely end there after sailors ‘mistook’ them for a different place. Now the wild and jagged cliffs are famous for another reason. They are at the centre of a debate about one of Earth’s greatest mysteries – just how and when did complex life first evolve?

“If you walk around the rocks you will find surfaces covered in literally thousands of fossils,” says Frankie Dunn, a paleobiologist at Oxford University.

The fossils were preserved about 570 million years ago during the Ediacaran period, when a series of volcanic eruptions covered the seafloor in ash, providing a ‘snapshot’ of life at the time.

“The way I would describe it is like walking around Pompeii, you can see the ghosts of the creatures that lived there buried under volcanic ash; it’s really an incredible experience,” says Dunn.

The Ediacaran fossils herald a watershed moment in the history of Earth – for the previous four billion years, the oceans had been the preserve of single-celled microbes, yet suddenly they were teeming with new complex life. And what strange life it was. The creatures look nothing like anything seen today.

Some, like the rangeomorphs resembled giant leafy ferns. Others had a bush, or cabbage-like appearance. Many looked like shapeless sacs, or thin, quilted pillows, while others bore a resemblance to enormous sea pens.

“Most Ediacarans are soft bodied and a bit squidgy,” says Simon Darroch, a paleontologist at Vanderbilt University in Tennessee. “The ability to form shells or skeletons didn’t evolve until the end of the Ediacaran period.”

   Australia fires: How do we know how many animals have died?

There is a widely-reported estimate that almost half a billion (480 million) animals have been killed by the bush fires in Australia.

It's a figure that came from Prof Chris Dickman, an expert on Australian biodiversity at the University of Sydney.

He released a statement explaining how he had reached the figure - a statement which refers to the number of animals affected rather than those necessarily dying as a direct result of the fire (although the title of the release talks about 480 million being killed).

The numbers are based on a report he co-wrote in 2007 for the World Wide Fund for Nature (WWF) on the impact of land-clearing on Australian wildlife in New South Wales.

It estimated that there were an average of 17.5 mammals, 20.7 birds and 129.5 reptiles per hectare (10,000 square metres, so a square 100m on each side - about the size of a rugby pitch).

They've then multiplied that by the amount of land hit by the fires.

"We've estimated that in the three million hectares of New South Wales alone that were burned up until about 10 days ago probably as many as 480 million mammals, birds and reptiles would have been affected by the fires," Prof Dickman said.

"Certainly, large animals, like kangaroos or emus - many birds, of course - will be able to move away from the fire as it approaches," he told BBC Breakfast.

"I guess it's the less mobile species and the smaller ones that depend on the forest itself that are really in the firing line."

But he added that many of those that survived the actual fire would die later because of lack of food or shelter.

Colin Beale, an ecologist from University of York told Reality Check that may have been overstated.

He said: "In the areas of Africa where I work I am quite sure that very few birds die as a direct result of fire. They certainly have the ability to fly away from fires, and this is surely the case in Australia, too."

There are a few caveats with these figures. First of all, the estimate is for damage only in New South Wales, and the fires have spread to Victoria.

Also, the three million hectares figure is somewhat out of date - the fires have spread since then. So it is likely that more animals have been affected than the estimate suggests.

But it is important to remember that this is just an estimate - its authors say the numbers are deliberately conservative. The figure for the number of reptiles is particularly uncertain, and reptiles make up three-quarters of the animals affected in these calculations.

"Density estimates are not available for many species, so they have had to be estimated from known densities of other species," Tom Oliver, professor of applied ecology at University of Reading, told Reality Check.

"For reptiles, there are no density estimates of individual species at all, just an estimate from a single study (Ehmann and Cogger 1985), which estimates 10 individuals per species per hectare."

Colin Beale added: "Although it is hard to find estimates of how well reptiles survive fires, in similar areas of Australia the majority of these reptiles live in the soil."

"Soil is a very good thermal insulator and burrowing reptiles can certainly show very low mortality even during intense fires."

"It seems extremely unlikely that the majority of the animals affected by fire are actually killed, though we may still ask whether they will survive longer-term."

   Plug-in and sail: Meet the electric ferry pioneers

   Image copyright Adrienne Murray Image caption Thomas Larsen captains Ellen, the world's biggest electric ferry

"Have a pleasant journey," blurts the tannoy, as the engines ramp up and we pull away from the harbour in Fynshav, southern Denmark.

I'm aboard Ellen, an electric-powered ferry, sailing to the island of Ærø, in the west Baltic Sea.

On the ship's bridge, Captain Thomas Larsen stands behind a panel with controls and electronic charts. "What I can see on these two screens is a power management system," he points out. "It shows me all my batteries. And how far I can expect to go."

"The main difference is that I don't have a full fuel tank. I need to think a lot about how I'm using my power."

As we talk an alarm starts beeping. "Oh this tells me I do not have power for a new return trip without recharging," Captain Larsen says calmly.

Powered entirely by batteries, Ellen is something of a Tesla among ferries. Fully charged, the 60m vessel can sail 22 nautical miles with up to 200 passengers and 30 cars onboard.

Image copyright Adrienne Murray Image caption Ellen has a range of 22 nautical miles

That's a roughly 40km (25-mile) round-trip, and seven times further than other electric ferries.

Ellen replaces an older diesel-powered vessel, and in the onboard cafe passengers welcome the change.

"It doesn't make so much noise. And no smoke from the diesel - it's good," one traveller tells me.

"It's very quiet. You don't feel anything. It's a great idea also for the environment," says another.

"Ferry shipping in general is very dirty business," says Halfdan Abrahamsen, an information officer from Ærø EnergyLab, as he shows me around.

More Technology of Business

Ships usually use marine diesel or heavy fuel oil, "which is just about the bottom of the food chain when it comes to product from refineries," says Mr Abrahamsen.

The only oil onboard Ellen is for the gearbox and in the kitchen for making French fries, he says.

The emission-free ferry is expected to reduce CO2 emissions by 2,000 tonnes a year. It's part of an EU-backed project to develop green ferries for longer routes.

Beyond a set of heavy metal doors, lies the engine and two battery rooms, where 840 lithium-ion batteries supplied by Swiss firm Leclanché, are stacked from floor to ceiling.

Image copyright Adrienne Murray Image caption Two battery rooms house 840 lithium-ion batteries

Totalling 4.3MWh, it has the biggest battery capacity of any ship at sea and equivalent to the average amount of electricity a UK household consumes each year.

And that means it can sail further than any other electric ferry operating at the moment, according to Kimmo Rauma, vice-president of Danfoss Editron, the Finland-based company behind the electrical propulsion and charging technology.

After a 70 minute voyage, Ellen arrives at the harbour in Søby and moors alongside the charging station.

A mechanical arm plugs in and recharges the batteries in less than 25 minutes with clean energy supplied by local wind turbines.

Ellen is not fully operational just yet, and it hasn't all been smooth sailing. Building a boat with so many batteries is complex and since being launched some battery cells have been replaced.

Image copyright Adrienne Murray Image caption Trine Heinemann says Ellen's running costs are a quarter that of a diesel ferry

"They're getting lighter and more energy dense, but they're still heavy," Trine Heinemann, the E-Ferry project coordinator explains, as we stand on the dockside.

"The more energy you need, the more batteries you need, the more weight you add. You then have to start thinking about how do we take other weight away from the ship? How do you build the most energy-efficient ship?"

A lower resistance design and more lightweight materials were used, contributing to Ellen's low running costs.

"We are paying maybe 25% of what you would pay for running a similar diesel vessel." says Ms Heinemann. "So that's the significant saving."

Maintenance costs are much lower too. A diesel engine has about 30,000 moving parts, in an electric motor it's just the bearings that need maintenance, Dr Rauma says.

Image copyright Adrienne Murray Image caption The green box on the right recharges Ellen's batteries

The ferry has cost €21.3m (US$23.6m; £18.3m), with the EU's Horizon 2020 programme funding €15m.

"It's maybe 40% more expensive than a conventional diesel vessel," Ms Heinemann says.

"Then you still have the transformer and the electrical infrastructure. So in terms of establishing an electrical vessel, we are looking at a significantly higher cost."

So while battery power is certainly greener, is it commercially viable? The team believes so.

"Some say within 14 months you break even and then it's saving from then on. We're being a little bit more conservative and saying maybe four or five years," says Ms Heinemann.

At Søby Shipyard, where Ellen was built, chief executive Roar Falkenberg thinks costs will come down.

"Ellen was a prototype. I think when we build the next Ellen, it will be only cost a bit more than a normal ferry. And if you look three to five years ahead, I think the price will be the same."

Batteries are getting more cost-competitive says Dr Tristan Smith, a shipping and energy expert from University College London, thanks largely to better technology and stricter emissions rules.

"If you have strong air quality regulation then you aren't able to burn the worst quality marine fuels," he says, "which then makes the battery more competitive, because it's now competing against the more expensive fossil fuel."

The shipping industry is responsible for around 3% of global CO2 and greenhouse gas emissions. In April 2018, the International Maritime Organisation set new targets to reduce these emissions by "at least 50% by 2050 compared to 2008" levels.

That's spurring industry players to explore new emission-cutting measures including alternatives fuels like LNG, biofuel, also hydrogen and ammonia which Dr Smith thinks show most promise.

Image copyright Norled Image caption Norled is part of a hydrogen-powered ferry project

Nordic countries have led a shift towards hybrid and electric power. The first fully-electric car ferry was launched in Norway a few years ago, and the operator Norled is now developing, what it claims will be the world's first hydrogen-fuelled ferry.

"The technology is ready," says Danfoss Editron's Kimmo Rauma. "The question is that the maritime industry is not the fastest to change."

His firm has supplied electric technology for patrol-boats, icebreakers, and fish farming service boats.

It also developed Asia's first e-ferry in Taiwan. He says retrofitting older diesel vessels with electric engines, particularly in city harbour areas, is a "big opportunity" to reduce pollution.

However experts say that scaling up battery power for large ships has significant limitations.

"The common denominator for successful battery use is that the vessels operate close to shore," says Maria Skipper Schwenn, a director at industry body, Danish Shipping.

"The operational reach is limited simply due to the capacity of the battery itself. It's simply not possible today when you are sailing more than 10 or 20 days at sea. In addition to that you need an enormous charging capacity in the port."

"With the technology we have right now… it doesn't seem like a viable solution for the deep-sea shipping. But for ferries, supply ships and tugboats, it's an excellent solution."

Back at Søby Shipyard, Roar Falkenberg agrees. "The key is how much energy can you store in the battery. If you have to sail from England to the United States, you need a lot! And then you can't have any cargo, you can only have batteries. Maybe in 10 years, 15 years, there will be other ways for longer ship routes."

"China is betting on AI and investing in AI and deploying AI on a scale no other country is doing," says Abishur Prakash, a futurist and author of books about the effect of artificial intelligence (AI) on geopolitics.

As developments in AI accelerate, some in the US fear that the ability of China's powerful central government to marshal data and pour resources into the field will push it ahead.

The country has announced billions in funding for start-ups, launched programmes to woo researchers from overseas and streamlined its data policies.

It has announced news-reading robots and AI-powered strategy for foreign relations. Perhaps most alarming to the US are its efforts to incorporate it into its military.

In the last few years, Washington has toughened oversight of Chinese investments, banned US firms from doing business with certain Chinese companies and increased criminal prosecution of alleged technology theft.

"What the Trump administration is doing is a sign... the US knows that its geopolitical power will be redefined and reconfigured by this era," said Mr Prakash, who works at the Toronto-based Center for Innovating the Future.

These developments come amid political tension between the two nations. Yet, some analysts worry the US response is counterproductive, arguing that cutting off access to US microchips, for example, could simply accelerate Chinese efforts to develop their own alternatives.

The Trump administration has imposed tariffs on billions of dollars worth of Chinese goods - retaliation for "unfair" practices it says are aimed at giving China an advantage in the field.

The White House has also pressed universities to review their relationships with Chinese partners and threatened to restrict student visas. It is even said to be looking at rules against certain US investments in China - once nearly unthinkable in free-market America.

Rivals is a season of in-depth coverage on BBC News about the contest for supremacy between the US and China across trade, tech, defence and soft power.

The actions are aimed at preserving US leadership in technologies expected to determine economic and military power for generations to come.

"That China will grow to be an economy as large as ours may be inevitable; that we aid their mercantilist strategy through free trade and open investment in our technology sector is a choice," US Department of Defense officials wrote in a widely cited 2018 report.

China advances

As the US and China race to capitalise on advances in machine learning, facial recognition and other forms of artificial intelligence, Tom Mitchell has a front row seat.

The professor of computer science founded the world's first research centre for artificial intelligence at Carnegie Mellon in the US. Since 2018, he has also served as chief scientist at Squirrel, a leading tutoring company in China.

He says the US has more experience building tech companies, but China may have the advantage when it comes to AI applications relying on big data sets - and points to the medical field as an example.

"In the US we've had electronic medical records for over 20 years but we still have not put together all the records in the country to run machine-learning algorithms on those."

He says the US has been inhibited by privacy concerns, as well as a fractured, for-profit industry.

"In China, it's a different situation. If the government decides that it's going to have country-wide electronic medical records... then it's going to happen."

Prof Mitchell, who is working on using AI to improve education, says working in both the US and China puts him in the best position to invent and apply cutting-edge technology.

But that kind of cross-border collaboration is facing increasing scrutiny, given rising political tensions.

Scaling back

Last year, Chinese investment in the US dropped to $4.8bn (£3.7bn) - its lowest level since 2011 - while US investment in China dipped from $14bn to $13bn, according to the Rhodium Group's annual report.

High-profile Chinese firms, like insurance giant Anbang and Kai-Fu Lee's Sinovation Ventures, have reportedly sold or scaled back US operations, while China's Huawei and ZTE have suffered serious losses after being subject to US bans.

In US academic circles, universities are rethinking their ties to China, while US firms doing business in China have also grown more cautious.

Mr Prakash, who works with start-ups, tech firms and governments on questions of artificial intelligence, says while many western firms continue to pursue opportunities in China, current tensions have changed the discussions.

"Geopolitics is now front and centre for all of them," he says. "They're forced to say, hey, we're based in Silicon Valley, we're selling to part of Asia and now as this tech war unfolds we need to understand what's possible, what can we do, what are our options."

More Technology of Business

Will it work?

Prof Mitchell says policymakers need to distinguish between AI applications that are win-win and those that are truly competitive, such as those for the military.

In the meantime, he says Washington's increasingly nationalist tone risks alienating America's foreign students and researchers - many of them Chinese - who have played a critical role in US tech leadership to date.

"To start thinking about putting up export control walls around the US could be as damaging to the US research enterprise as anything that a foreign adversary might try to do to us. I hope we will act rationally and not just out of fear."

Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Prof Mitchell says some AI advances are win-win

While US concerns about technology theft have merit, "I feel like we're over-reacting," says Prof Mitchell.

"The fact that China or the UK or anybody decides they want to be a leader in AI - it would be surprising if they did not. It's not something to be reviled," he says.

American national plans have also called for boosting investment, reforming the immigration system and improving education, but those are much more difficult to achieve, says William Carter, deputy director of technology policy at Washington's Center for Strategic and International Studies.

"Being hard on China is an easy political sell," he says, but warns that, "I think we're shooting ourselves in the foot in a lot of ways".

Image copyright Getty Images Image caption AI technologies have sparked debate over surveillance and privacy

The race between the US and China is now moving to other countries, which are being pushed to take sides as tech firms from the two compete for turf.

The US has pressed its allies to stop using equipment from China's Huawei, for example, citing concerns that Beijing could use the firm's equipment for hacking. It has also raised human rights concerns.

At a recent conference, a US official argued that Chinese tech companies are "de facto tools" of the state's Communist Party, saying they "have become deeply enmeshed in Beijing's system of oppression at home and its increasingly assertive strategic ambitions globally."

As artificial intelligence technologies drive debates over values like surveillance and privacy, free speech and censorship, conflicts between the two countries are likely to increase, says Nicholas Wright, a fellow at the New America think tank in Washington, who has worked with the US and UK governments.

"To some extent, this is just a generic challenge, where you have a new set of technologies and whomever manages to implement them first and best will gain an advantage... but then there's also another set of issues which is to do with the specifics of these new digital technologies," he says.

For now, it may take artificial intelligence to know how the race will end.

"When I put in the earpieces and goggles the first time it was crazy - it feels so believable," says Anna Taylor, 32, of her visit to a virtual reality (VR) arcade.

"The whole experience of being immersed in a compelling virtual world is incredible."

Anna has since visited the east London arcade many times, at first alone and then with others. But despite her enthusiasm for gaming, she won't be buying her own virtual reality headset.

"I wouldn't invest in buying virtual reality applications for home," she explains. "It's fine to play more of a basic game when you are playing with other people, [and] because it's brand new there are more layers of excitement. But when you're [playing] on your own, you want the quality you are used to."

As a keen gamer, Anna should be part of the core audience for at-home VR entertainment.

But her lack of interest is pretty common, and it means that virtual reality headsets have yet to take off.

Image copyright Anna Taylor Image caption Anna Taylor with her partner Anjay: "I wouldn't invest in buying virtual reality applications for home," she says

Many big name adopters have abandoned their VR projects. Google recently halted sales of Daydream, its VR headset, admitting that "there just hasn't been the broad consumer or developer adoption we had hoped".

Meanwhile, the BBC has announced it is ending the funding for its VR hub, less than two years after it was founded.

And there were few big VR announcements at CES, the annual trade show for consumer electronics, which got underway this week.

However, PlayStation did announce it has sold five million VR headsets since launch in 2016.

Collective experience

However, one space in which virtual reality is thriving is group entertainment.

By its nature VR offers a gateway to a shared world, and in a group setting everyone gets change from £20 rather than shelling out hundreds for a headset.

East London VR arcade Otherworld launched last year. It already sees 1,000 visitors a week through its doors, 60% of whom are female and half aged 25-34.

More Technology of Business

"Millennials are spending their income more and more on shared experience over consumption," says co-founder Chris Adams.

"Otherworld's immersion rooms provide the space and technology for a hyper-real, undisturbed journey into virtual reality which cannot be achieved at home."

Simon Windsor, who runs immersive media firm Hammerhead VR, has also largely kept away from the personal entertainment market.

"A few years ago there was an awful lot of hype around VR and some of that has not been fulfilled in terms of consumer adoption of the technology," Simon admits. "But the way you can interact with this world now is much more natural and intuitive."

Image copyright Hammerhead Image caption Madonna and her holographic double at the 2019 Billboard Music Awards

Hammerhead uses VR to create a spectacle for big audiences in the worlds of entertainment, sport and business, alongside company training.

Simon helped create Madonna's hologram performance at the 2019 Billboard Music Awards and captured Anthony Joshua's boxing moves for Sky viewers, alongside providing training for companies like Pearson.

"Whether it's home game play, retail, virtual entertainment, a lot of the technology barriers have been removed," he says.

Image copyright Otherworld Image caption Otherworld customers enter pods for a VR experience

Beyond entertainment

Because of its immersive nature, virtual reality is also increasingly used to encourage empathy or create unique experiences.

That could be anything from headsets for children to teach them about bullying, or enabling a care home resident to swim virtually with dolphins or explore their childhood home.

Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Virtual reality is being used to help people with dementia revisit their past.

It has proved particularly useful in medicine, helping surgeons experience different types of operations or distracting burns patients from pain.

Some post-traumatic stress disorder sufferers saw an almost 40% improvement in their symptoms in a trial that involved walking on a treadmill in front of a screen projecting images of the type of trauma experienced.

Mainstream use of virtual reality in our homes and workplaces was probably one of the most popular technology predictions of the past half century.

Unlike flying cars or teleportation, virtual reality headsets have been in development since the late 1960s.

There was a wave of expectation around VR in 2016, seen by many tech watchers as the year virtual reality would go mainstream.

Despite these bursts of optimism, it has never quite broken through. Today, few own their own headsets or use virtual reality in their day-to-day work.

Image copyright Otherworld Image caption Otherworld virtual reality summer background

Consultancy CCS Insights estimates 10 million headsets will be in circulation worldwide by the end of 2019, 21% growth on the previous year.

But it acknowledges this "might seem disappointing considering the huge hype" around VR, with still just a handful of successful devices available.

A major issue is that the price of headsets has remained very expensive.

"I think VR remains a very niche technology," says James Gautrey, a portfolio manager at Schroders who specialises in analysing technology stocks.

"Mass adoption remains impeded by the hardware required to run it, in my opinion. Take videogames - you need a very powerful PC, a good amount of space, sensors set up around it, and of course the VR helmet itself.

"The cost runs to thousands and for most it is completely impractical not to mention too expensive.

"There are clearly benefits using it to train people where real life 'on the job' training is dangerous, such as pilots, surgeons, deep sea divers. But beyond that and specialist video gamers, I have not seen any compelling use cases that would make it more mainstream."

   Image caption Professor Yue is working on next generation computer chips

On a university campus on the outskirts of Hong Kong a group of engineers are designing computer chips they hope will be used in the next generation of Chinese made smart phones.

Patrick Yue leans back in his chair in a coffee shop on the campus, sporting a Stanford University t-shirt. He is the lead engineer and professor overseeing the project.

His research team designs optical communication chips, which use light rather than electrical signals to transfer information, and are needed in 5G mobile phones and other internet-connected devices.

He tells me about the challenges China faces in developing a world-beating computer chip industry.

"I actually think the actual designers will be as big a bottle neck as the manufacturing. We don't have nearly as many research institutes and industry bases to train the designers," he says.

His department is part-funded by Huawei, the Chinese communications and telecom giant at the centre of an international political storm.

In May the US added Huawei to a list of companies that US firms cannot trade with unless they have a licence, blaming security concerns.

Rivals is a season of in-depth coverage on BBC News about the contest for supremacy between the US and China across trade, tech, defence and soft power.

Read more here.

Many industry observers fear that the US-Chinese trade war, risks unravelling the global technology supply chain.

In particular, China relies on overseas companies for computer chips (or semiconductors), the tiny devices used in everything from consumer electronics to military hardware.

"Politically everything can be used as a bargaining power," says Mr Yue.

"If these companies and countries start to hold back on technology then everyone will get hurt. It's not good from a technological point of view," Mr Yue says.

China has made no secret of its desire to become self-sufficient in technology. The nation is both the world's largest importer and consumer of semiconductors.

It currently produces just 16% of the semiconductors fuelling its tech boom.

But it has plans to produce 40% of all semiconductors it uses by 2020, and 70% by 2025, an ambitious plan spurred by the trade war with the US.

Image copyright Getty Images Image caption China's President Xi Jinping wants to end the country's dependence on foreign chip suppliers

In May 2018 China's President Xi Jinping met with the country's leading scientists and engineers, calling for specialists to work towards self-reliance in the production of core technologies.

That meeting was just a month after the US government banned US firms from selling components to ZTE, China's second-largest maker of telecom network equipment.

The ban highlighted to China's leaders that the nation's tech boom was dependent on foreign technology.

In October this year, in its latest bid to help wean the nation's tech sector away from US technology, the Chinese government created a $29bn (£22bn) fund to support the semiconductor industry.

"There is no question that China has the engineers to make chips. The question is whether they can make competitive ones," questions Piero Scaruffi, a Silicon Valley historian, and artificial intelligence researcher who works in Silicon Valley.

More Technology of Business

"Certainly, Huawei can develop its own chips and operating systems, and the government can make sure that they will be successful in China. But Huawei and other Chinese phone makers are successful also in foreign markets, and that's a totally different question: Will Huawei's chips and operating systems be as competitive as Qualcomm's and Android? Most likely not. At best, it will take years before they are," Mr Scaruffi adds.

Mr Scaruffi estimates that China could be as many as 10 years behind the leading producers of high-end computer chips. The majority of chips made for high-end electronics are manufactured by specialist foundries like the Taiwanese Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC). It produces more than 70% of chips designed by third party companies.

Just securing the best machinery needed to make high-end chips is difficult.

"To start out with equipment, its very high precision equipment. You need to print very fine features. The equipment that is needed to have this kind of technology is controlled by a few companies in the world," says Mr Yue.

He believes that Chinese technology is three to four generations behind companies like TSMC. China lacks the industry experience to manufacture high end chips, he says. But he believes that companies like Huawei are already competitive when it comes to designing chips.

Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Huawei has been put on a US government blacklist

Where does this leave the tech giant Huawei?

Mr Yue argues that Huawei is trying to replicate the successful business models of firms like Samsung, which produces its own computer chips - rather than trying to fall into line with Beijing's industrial ambitions.

"You can almost view them as an integrated company with the expertise of what Apple or Qualcomm has," says Mr Yue.

Li Changzhu is a lifelong employee of Huawei and president of the company's handset business. He joined the company 23 years ago as a fresh graduate and has watched it grow into the international tech giant. He claims that the goal of companies like Huawei is simply to satisfy consumer needs.

"We are open to use other vendors chipsets. Every year we purchase a lot of chips from Qualcomm. We are open to that. We use the best chipsets to satisfy our customers," he says sitting on the side of a tech conference in Macau, a semi- autonomous southern Chinese city.

Image caption China aims to supply 70% of its demand for chips by 2025

Growth in the semiconductor industry is typically driven by disruptive new technologies. In the late 2000s the introduction of smartphones boosted demand for the tiny integrated circuits that control everything from memory to Bluetooth and wifi.

But today China's ambition to dominate sectors such as artificial intelligence and 5G is expected to further ramp up demand for high-end chips.

Industry analysts like Mr Scaruffi question China's ability to truly innovate. "Every Chinese city wants to build its own Silicon Valley. It tends to be more driven from the top. Silicon Valley had a big advantage, that it was very far away from the political power," says Mr Scaruffi.

He believes that China's technological success lies in the implementation of technology rather than its creation.

"If your metric is how many people use smart phones to go shopping then China wins big time. But if your metric is Nobel Prize winners, then China is losing badly. China of course has been very successful in implementing technology in a way that dramatically alters society," he says.

   The garlic farmers who love Trump's tariffs

US garlic growers say they have finally started to win their 25-year battle with Chinese imports - thanks to President Donald Trump.

The president slapped a second round of tariffs on garlic from China this year, boosting demand for the US-grown crop.

"It is untrue that there are no winners in a trade war," says Ken Christopher, executive vice president of California-based Christopher Ranch, the nation's latest garlic producer.

"When President Trump's tariffs for garlic kicked in, it was at that point that California garlic truly became competitive."

Image caption Mr Christopher says that thousands of jobs in the US domestic garlic industry are now protected

US garlic growers have complained since the early 1990s that China was flooding the US with the pungent vegetable, selling it at below the cost of production. This is a trade practice known as "dumping".

The US government investigated, and back in 1994 agreed that some Chinese firms were indeed selling their garlic in the US "at less than fair value".

As a result, any Chinese company found guilty of the practice was hit by a whopping 377% duty. However, Chinese firms soon found ways around these case-by-case penalties, such as by simply setting up new shell businesses.

Mr Christopher likened it to "playing whack-a-mole", and cheap Chinese garlic continued to flood into the US. As a result of this, of the 12 US commercial garlic farms that existed in the 1990s, only three of the largest producers survived.

Today the remaining US garlic farmers say that Trump's tariffs on Chinese garlic are working because they apply across the board and straight away - there is now no way for the importers to get around them.

US tariffs on Chinese garlic were first set at 10% in September 2018, before rising to 25% from May of this year.

Image caption The US garlic industry is centred on the Californian city of Gilroy

"Trump's tariffs are all assessed and billed up front," says Mr Christopher. "So it is impossible for dumpers from China to evade them."

Christopher Ranch was one of the three US garlic producers that made it through the 1990s. Today it harvests more than 100 million pounds (45 million kg) of the bulbs every year, supplying almost one third of all fresh garlic consumed in the US.

Mr Christopher says that the family-owned business has seen sales soar since the tariffs on Chinese imports were first put in place.

"We're seeing growth year-over-year of between 6 to 23% every week on our fresh garlic," he says. "It may not seem like a lot, but when measured in millions of pounds [in weight of sales] it makes a huge difference to our bottom line."

To access the impact of the tariffs, the BBC looked at daily prices measured by the US Department of Agriculture.

For white garlic sold in Boston in August, 2018, a 30lb (13.6kg) box from China cost between $25 and $30 (£19 and £23). A container of Californian garlic of the same size was $68.

Following the tariffs, the cost of the same box of Chinese garlic has risen to between $52 and $55, while the Californian garlic is now between $70 and $74. So while the Chinese garlic is still cheaper, the difference in price has markedly narrowed.

Image copyright Vessey &amp; Co Image caption Californian farming business Vessey &amp; Co closed its garlic division after growing it alongside cabbage and cauliflower for 100 years

Fourth generation Californian farmer Jack Vessey is, however, missing out on the renewed demand for US garlic - his family business Vessey &amp; Company stopped growing the crop a number of years ago, as they couldn't make it profitable in the face of the Chinese imports.

"Stepping away from the garlic business was a very difficult decision for me," he says.

"There were three generations before me who dedicated much of their lives to garlic. [But] I decided that if there was a chance for our business to survive into a fifth generation we had to divest our garlic holdings."

For almost 100 years his family had grown garlic together with other vegetables, such as cabbage and cauliflower.

Rivals is a season of in-depth coverage on BBC News about the contest for supremacy between the US and China across trade, tech, defence and soft power.

Read more here.

"Garlic, for many years, accounted for more than 50% of our receipts," adds Mr Vessey. "But once the Chinese began dumping product in the US market, we started to cut back on our acreage and build other sectors of our business."

Frank Lavin, a former Under Secretary for International Trade at the Department of Commerce, explains that the problem with the levy introduced in 1994 was that the Chinese importers were too fast on their feet.

"They would be discovered and sanctioned, and then they would simply set up another dummy structure," he says.

"The fact is they were more nimble, occasionally, in setting up these entities than US Customs could be in discovering them."

Image caption Higher garlic prices are now being passed onto consumers, but Mr Christopher says the US industry needed help

Mr Christopher says that - by contrast - President Trump's tariffs "are very easy to enforce because garlic can't even enter the country now before the tariff is billed to them. That's what's tactically changing the game."

He adds that the media is wrong to attack the president's strident tariff policy - the US has now put in place tariffs on $200bn of Chinese goods.

"It's been a difficult thing to talk about, as the media continually simplifies the tariffs as injuring farmers, whereas it actually benefits the domestic garlic industry," says Mr Christopher.

Global Trade

More from the BBC's series taking an international perspective on trade:

However, trade experts caution that higher costs are likely to be passed onto consumers.

"If you are a domestic firm that is being sheltered from foreign competition by tariff walls, then you tend to like tariffs because it keeps out foreign competition," says Deborah Elms, head of the Temasek Foundation Centre for Trade and Negotiations.

"But what that does is keep out foreign competition and allow domestic competitors to potentially provide goods that are less competitive in the longer run."

Mr Christopher says that while he understands that it is "not in the long-term macroeconomic interest of the US to engage in trade wars, our industry needed immediate relief".

   Image copyright Getty Images Image caption President Trump's tax cuts have given Americans more money to spend, often on imported goods

President Donald Trump's approach to international trade is driven to a large extent by his belief that the United States is being unfairly treated by other countries.

His main supporting evidence is the trade deficit - the US buys more than it sells internationally.

He has referred to the deficit as losing money. In one tweet he wrote about losing $500bn (£388bn) a year as a result of crazy trade with China. No more, he promised.

One of his central economic objectives has been to reduce it. In November 2017, his first year in office, he referred to the total deficit with all trade partners of almost $800bn a year as unacceptable. He said: "We are going to start whittling that down, and as fast as possible".

Rivals is a season of in-depth coverage on BBC News about the contest for supremacy between the US and China across trade, tech, defence and soft power.

Read more here.

But it hasn't come down. The figure that President Trump referred to was for trade in goods alone. It has increased in both of the full years since he took office.

It was $750bn in the final year under President Barack Obama, $887bn in 2018, and the increase has continued. We have figures for the first nine months of this year, showing the deficit was larger, though only slightly, than in the same period of 2018.

Mr Trump focuses on bilateral deficits, often suggesting they are evidence of the unfair actions of the other country concerned.

The deficit with China is by far the largest. It rose in Mr Trump's first two years, but for the first nine months of 2019 it is lower. Both imports and exports have fallen, imports by more.

Image copyright Getty Images Image caption President Trump believes the US is being unfairly treated by other countries when it comes to trade

That is hardly surprising as the two countries have applied increased tariffs to large swathes of one another's goods.

So a success for President Trump? Only if you think bilateral trade balances really matter. And most economists think they don't.

Getting one bilateral deficit down does not guarantee you reduce the overall deficit. The deficit with China may be down, but others have increased - Vietnam, Mexico and Taiwan for example.

Global Trade

More from the BBC's series taking an international perspective on trade:

Part of the underlying story is the fact that the trade balance with the rest of the world is mainly driven not by barriers that countries put in the way of one another's goods.

Instead, it's about whether countries buy more goods and services than they produce. Prof Greg Mankiw of Harvard University (who used to be a supporter of the Republican Party) puts it like this: "If you really want to reduce a trade deficit, the way to do it is to bring down spending relative to production, not to demonise trading partners around the world."

Image copyright Getty Images Image caption President Trump's tax cuts have given a boost to the US economy, though that may now be fading

President Trump has, if anything, done just the opposite. His tax cuts have given a boost to the US economy, though that may now be fading. But it's not really surprising that the trade deficit should rise as Americans - families and businesses - have had more to spend, and some of that money goes on imported goods.

There is an idea in economics known as the "twin deficits hypothesis", that there is a link between a government budget deficit and a trade deficit - or strictly speaking, a current account deficit that includes some financial transactions in addition to trade in goods and services.

It is by no means a settled debate, but the idea that tax cuts can in some circumstances lead to a larger trade deficit is entirely credible.

So there is a coherent story here that President Trump has taken steps - tax cuts - that make it harder to achieve something else he wants - a reduction in the trade deficit.

That's not to say that President Trump isn't on to something, in the sense that his views on trade may reflect real economic damage in some communities. The Nobel Prize winner Esther Duflo says there is among economists an "instinctive view on trade, that it should be good for everyone". But it's not true she says.

Although trade boosts growth overall, it does produce concentrated pockets of job losses, she says. That's not a new view, and it doesn't mean you can turn the clock back or reverse the losses by putting up new trade barriers.

   Image caption Entrepreneur Jun Yu takes three smarthphones out with him everyday

Jun Yu can't resist gadgets.

More than 20 smartphones, old tablets and other devices lurk in a corner of his Beijing home - an ever-growing tech junkyard.

His apartment also boasts a Google Home smart assistant and an Amazon Echo.

"I take three phones out with me every day. I use a phone for Chinese apps, I use my iPhone for Gmail and western apps, and I use my Google Pixel phone for work," says the 34-year-old tech entrepreneur.

His obsession has paid off though. In 2009, he bought the first phone to use Android, the software that now runs more than 80% of smartphones.

A year later, the physics graduate, founded his own company creating content for Chinese Android users. By 2016 he had sold the company for an undisclosed amount to Alibaba, the Chinese e-commerce giant.

Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Chinese technology firms see 5G as an opportunity to overtake rivals

Now he is excited about the next generation of technology, known as 5G. It promises lightning fast internet connections for your mobile phone - fast enough to download movies in a matter of seconds, or to stream high definition TV.

In October, Jun Yu pre-ordered a 5G-ready smartphone, made by China's Xiaomi.

"4G has enabled many things like mobile video, more immersive gaming. I know 5G will too. But I don't exactly know how yet," he says.

But in the US and UK the rollout of 5G networks has been hampered by an international row over one of the most important suppliers of 5G equipment, China's Huawei.

Rivals is a season of in-depth coverage on BBC News about the contest for supremacy between the US and China across trade, tech, defence and soft power.

Read more here.

The US has banned the use of Huawei equipment in 5G networks over security fears, and has encouraged its allies to do the same. It also maintains a tight control over what US companies can sell to Huawei, which has disrupted sales of Huawei phones overseas.

Industry analysts like Edison Lee, an analyst from financial services group Jefferies, see the US pressure on Huawei as an attempt to break China's potential dominance of the global 5G market.

"The tech war is based on America's argument that China's technological advances have been built upon stolen intellectual property rights, and heavy government subsidies, and their belief that Chinese telecom equipment is not safe, and is a national security threat to the US and its allies," he says.

Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Huawei has built around half of China's 5G network

"As Huawei and [fellow Chinese firm] ZTE increasingly dominate the global telecom equipment market, the western world will be more vulnerable to Chinese spying," Lee adds.

Huawei has always strongly denied that its technology can be used for spying.

While western nations worry about one of the key suppliers of 5G technology, China is racing ahead with its 5G rollout.

On 31 October Chinese telecom companies launched 5G services in more than 50 Chinese cities, creating one of the world's largest 5G networks.

Huawei has built an estimated 50% of the network.

The Chinese Ministry of Information claims that in just 20 days the country registered more than 800,000 subscribers. Analysts predict China will have as many as 110 million 5G users by 2020.

And China's tech sector is busy coming up with uses for the new tech.

Image copyright HK Applied Science Institute Image caption 5G could be a key piece of technology for autonomous cars

On a large plot of land in northern Hong Kong, researchers are developing 5G powered autonomous vehicles.

Researchers at Hong Kong Applied Science and Technology Research Institution are working in partnership with China Mobile, the largest telecom company in China.

They see 5G as being particularly useful for self-driving cars, allowing the cars to build an accurate picture of what's going on around them, by communicating with other vehicles, traffic signals and sensors in the road.

"For consumers, 5G will possibly transform how we interact with other. For the government, 5G will transform roads and road infrastructure to enable new applications like enhanced assisted-driving and eventually autonomous driving," says Alex Mui, a researcher on the project.

China is not the first country to roll out 5G. But it is building one of the world's biggest 5G markets very quickly.

While Huawei and ZTE are doing well from that expansion, they would still like to break into lucrative overseas markets like the US.

Speaking at a 5G convention in Beijing in November, China's minister for industry and information accused America of using cybersecurity as an excuse for protectionism.

"No country should ban a company in its 5G network rollout by using the unproved allegations of cybersecurity risks," said Miao Wei.

More Technology of Business

Industry analysts are not confident that the row between China and the US will be sorted out anytime soon.

"We see the current tensions as a technological Cold War, as tech nationalism intensifies," says Ben Wood, chief of research, at CCS Insight.

"With the Chinese government firmly committed to establishing China as a world-leading 5G nation, the opportunity for Huawei in its home market is immense.

"However, the rest of the world can't afford to get left behind, and without access to Huawei infrastructure US mobile network operators in particular will need to rely on alternative suppliers who may be more expensive and less advanced with 5G."

Gillette adverts stand against toxic masculinity. Budweiser makes specially-decorated cups to encourage non-binary and gender-fluid people to feel pride in their identity.

These examples of so-called "woke capitalism"- of corporations promoting progressive social causes - may feel ostentatiously up-to-the-moment. But woke capitalism is not as new as you might think.

Back in 1850, social progress certainly had further to go.

A couple of years earlier, American campaigner Elizabeth Cady Stanton had caused controversy at a women's rights convention by calling for women to be given the vote. Even her supporters worried that it was too ambitious.

Meanwhile, in Boston, a failed actor was trying to make his fortune as an inventor.

He had rented space in a workshop showroom, hoping to sell his machine for carving wooden type. But wooden type was falling out of fashion. The device was ingenious, but nobody wanted to buy one.

The workshop owner invited the demoralised inventor to take a look at another product which was also struggling: a sewing machine. It did not work very well. Nobody had succeeded in making one that did, despite many attempts for many decades.

The opportunity was clear. True, the time of a seamstress was not expensive - as the New York Herald said: "We know of no class of workwomen who are more poorly paid for their work or who suffer more privation and hardship." But sewing took so much time - 14 hours for a single shirt - that there would be a fortune in speeding it up.

And it was not only seamstresses who suffered: most wives and daughters were expected to sew. This "never-ending, ever-beginning" task, in the words of contemporary writer Sarah Hale, made their lives "nothing but a dull round of everlasting toil".

In that Boston workshop, the inventor sized up the machine he had been asked to admire, and quipped: "You want to do away with the only thing that keeps women quiet."

50 Things That Made the Modern Economy highlights the inventions, ideas and innovations that helped create the economic world.

It is broadcast on the BBC World Service. You can find more information about the programme's sources and listen to all the episodes online or subscribe to the programme podcast.

That failed-actor-turned-inventor was Isaac Merritt Singer. He was flamboyant, charismatic, capable of great generosity - but ruthless, too.

He was an incorrigible womaniser who fathered at least 22 children.

Image copyright Getty Images

For years he managed to run three families, not all of whom were aware the others existed, and all while technically still married to someone else entirely. At least one woman complained that he beat her.

Singer was, in short, not a natural supporter of women's rights - although his behaviour might have rallied some women to the cause.

His biographer, Ruth Brandon, dryly remarks that he was "the kind of man who adds a certain backbone of solidity to the feminist movement".

Singer contemplated the prototype sewing machine.

"In place of the shuttle going round in a circle," he told the workshop owner, "I would have it move to and fro in a straight line, and in place of the needle bar pushing a curved needle horizontally, I would have a straight needle moving up and down."

Singer patented his tweaks, and started to sell his version of the machine. It was impressive: the first design that really worked. You could make a shirt in just an hour.

Image copyright Getty Images Image caption The first Singer sewing machine was patented in 1851

Unfortunately, it also relied on various other innovations which had already been patented by other inventors - such as the grooved, eye-pointed needle, to make a lock stitch, and the mechanism for feeding the cloth.

During the so-called "sewing machine war" of the 1850s, rival manufacturers seemed to be more interested in suing each other for patent infringement than selling sewing machines.

Finally, a lawyer banged their heads together, pointing out that between them were four lots of people who owned patents to all the elements needed to make a good machine. Why not license each other, and work together to sue everyone else?

More things that made the modern economy:

Freed from legal distractions, the sewing machine market took off - and Singer came to dominate it. That might have surprised anyone who had seen how his factories compared with those of his rivals.

Others had rushed to embrace what was known as the "American system" of manufacturing, using bespoke tools and interchangeable parts. Yet Singer was late to this party: for years his machines were made from hand-filed parts and store-bought nuts and bolts.

But Singer and his canny business partner, Edward Clark, were pioneers in another way: marketing.

Sewing machines were expensive, costing several months' income for the average family.

Clark came up with the idea of hire purchase: families could rent the machine for a few dollars a month - and, when their rental payments totalled the purchase price, they would own it.

Image copyright Getty Images

It helped overcome the bad reputation built up by the slower, less reliable machines of bygone years. So did Singer's army of agents, who would set up the machine when you bought it, and call back to check it was working.

Still, all these marketing efforts faced a problem. And that problem was misogyny.

For a flavour of the attitudes Stanton was up against, consider two cartoons. One shows a man asking why you would buy a "sewing machine" when you could simply marry one.

In another, a salesman says women will get more time to "improve their intellects!" The absurdity was understood.

Image copyright Punch Cartoon Library / TopFoto

Such prejudice fuelled doubts that women could operate these expensive machines.

Singer's business depended on showing that they could, no matter how little respect he might have shown for the women in his own life.

He rented a shop window on Broadway in New York, and employed young women to demonstrate his machines - they drew quite a crowd.

Singer's adverts cast women as decision-makers: "Sold only by the maker directly to the women of the family." They implied that women should aspire to financial independence: "Any good female operator can earn with them $1,000 a year!"

By 1860, the New York Times was gushing: no other invention had brought "so great a relief for our mothers and daughters". Seamstresses had found "better remuneration and lighter toil".

Image copyright Getty Images Image caption A seamstress using a Singer sewing machine in 1907

Still, the Times rather undercut its gender-conscious credentials by attributing all this to the "inventive genius of man".

Perhaps we should ask a woman. Here's Sarah Hale, from Godey's Lady's Book and Magazine in 1860: "The needlewoman is… able to rest at night, and have time through the day for family occupations and enjoyments. Is this not a great gain for the world?"

There are plenty of sceptics about "woke capitalism" today. It is all just a ruse to sell more beer and razors, isn't it? Perhaps it is. Singer liked to say he cared only for the dimes.

But he is also proof that that social progress can be advanced by the most self-interested of motives.

   Image copyright Rolls-Royce Image caption The Ultrafan engine has giant carbon composite blades tipped with titanium

"It's on another scale from anything I've seen before," says Lorna Carter who recently started working at a new Rolls-Royce research and development facility near Bristol.

She works with giant robots which lay thousands of strips of carbon fibre tape to form a cylinder some 3.7m (almost 12ft) in diameter.

The cylinder forms the outer shell of Rolls-Royce's new engine, the Ultrafan.

Still under development, Rolls-Royce says the Ultrafan will be quieter and more fuel efficient than anything it has made before.

It will certainly be bigger.

"The component we're trying to make is massive and we are at capacity, it's really stretching the limits of what we can do," says Ms Carter.

At the £25m facility Rolls-Royce has also developed robots that can make fan blades from carbon fibre, a process that has taken more than 10 years to perfect.

Image caption Lorna Carter works with robots to build engine casings

Making the fan casing and blades from carbon fibre should result in a 20% weight saving compared with previous materials.

And that's important as the aerospace industry is under pressure to reduce its environmental impact. Aircraft are getting more efficient, but airline traffic is growing even faster.

Rolls-Royce estimates that 37,000 new passenger aircraft will be needed over the next 20 years.

More Technology of Business

"We've come a long way, but the challenge is to decouple emissions growth from traffic growth," says Alan Newby, future programmes director at Rolls-Royce.

The new engine will also incorporate a gearbox, allowing a much bigger fan, which results in a more efficient engine.

It's an innovation already being used on a smaller engine from US-based Pratt &amp; Whitney Engine, the PW1000G.

While Rolls-Royce and others in the aerospace industry are working on electric and hybrid propulsion systems for aircraft, for long-haul aircraft, at the moment jet engines are the only option.

Image caption The giant new Rolls-Royce engine needs a fan case 3.7m wide

Given that it is a technology that has been around since World War Two, how much more efficiency can be squeezed out of the jet engine?

Quite a lot, according to Professor Pericles Pilidis, who is head of power and propulsion department at Cranfield University's Centre for Propulsion Engineering.

His department works with on research projects with aerospace companies including Airbus and Rolls-Royce.

"I do expect improvements to continue," he says. Better materials, more efficient shapes and improved coatings can all contribute to make engines lighter and stronger.

He also points out that lighter engines mean the aircraft structure can be lighter as it has to carry less weight.

Those kind of incremental changes might not sound like much, but in the airline business they can make a big difference.

"Evolutionary changes, they sound unimpressive - 10% here 12% there. But in the airline business with very thin margins, that is the difference between life and death," says Richard Aboulafia, vice-president of analysis at the Teal Group.

One UK firm though is looking to make a step change in propulsion. Reaction Engines is developing a rocket engine, called Sabre, to be used on high-speed aircraft and on spacecraft.

At the kind of speeds Reaction is aiming for, Mach 5 (five times the speed of sound) the air coming into the engine can reach temperatures of 1,000C.

Image copyright Reaction Engines Image caption Reaction Engines hopes its engines will allow travel at over five times the speed of sound

That temperature would destroy the engine, so Reaction has developed a cooling system which can chill the incoming air in a fraction of a second.

The so-called pre-cooler is made from miniature tubes, less than 1mm thick, that can pipe coolant under high pressure through the system, and whisk heat away.

"The Sabre is completely unique, there's nobody else in the world, that we are aware of, that's developing an air-breathing rocket engine," says Mark Thomas, chief executive of Reaction Engines.

"Our pre-cooler technology... is in a different class to anything out there. It's ultra-high performance, ultra lightweight, highly miniaturised... it's just in a different league completely."

Reaction Engines plans to start building the Sabre engine this year and test it in 2021.

Reaction's pre-cooler can also potentially be used on conventional jet engines to make them more efficient, an idea being tested with Rolls-Royce.

According to Prof Pericles it will be another 30 years until we see a radical change in passenger aircraft.

By then he thinks there will be a transition from the current design, which is basically a tube, with engines hanging below the wings, to a "blended wing" design.

Image copyright Cranfield University Image caption In 30 years time aircraft might look more like this design from Cranfield University

Under that design, the aircraft is just one set of wings, with engines sitting on the top.

Those engines might even by powered by hydrogen, which has the potential to be a very low emission fuel.

"Hydrogen fuel is unavoidable," says Prof Pilidis. "It is a long-term solution to decarbonise aviation completely.

However, environmentalists says action needs to be taken sooner.

"There's always a role for technology to play in cutting emissions, but solving the climate crisis is something we need to get on with right now," says Jenny Bates, a campaigner at Friends of the Earth.

"The priority instead needs to be emissions cuts by having fewer planes in the sky. This is a crucial part of preventing further climate breakdown."

Australia's deadly wildfires have devastated huge swathes of territory and left thousands homeless. Many businesses have also been destroyed, among them vineyards which have taken generations to grow, as the BBC's Peter Hoskins writes.

"It's a bit like losing a parent, a mother or father," says James Tilbrook.

He is no stranger to wildfires. The Adelaide Hills region, where his winery and vineyard once stood, had twice been hit by major blazes in the two decades he's tended this land.

When smoke appeared on the horizon on the morning of 20 December he knew it was going to be bad but could only hope his 20 acres (8 hectares) would again be spared.

As the flames grew closer there was nothing that could be done but flee the fire. He returned to a scene of almost total devastation.

Image copyright Tilbrook Estate Image caption The scene of devastation when James Tilbrook returned to his vineyard

"I started looking around me, and all the land was black."

For him, the emotional impact was akin to losing a close family member and the grieving process that follows.

"You know, the very first day that it happens, or maybe up to a week afterwards, you're absolutely in shock and then you go to the funeral... and it's another shock."

Within a matter of hours the Tilbrook family had been left without a livelihood, as well as facing the huge cost of replacing what had been lost in the fire.

Image copyright Tilbrook Estate Image caption Fire completely destroyed James Tilbrook's winery on 20 December

"From the business point of view, we've lost our income, we've lost our livelihood."

"I'm reckoning that two years-worth of income, plus the equipment, conservatively, is about half a million (Australian) dollars (£262,800; $344,000).

"Then there's all the cost of the vineyard... potentially another $200,000... You're talking about $700,000."

Much left to burn

Mr Tilbrook's story is one that has been seen time and time again as the bushfires swept across Australia, hitting large parts of the wine industry.

Since September, at least 27 people have died in fires, which have destroyed more than 10 million hectares across the country.

The fires, and the severe drought that contributed to them, is seriously affecting producers, according to industry lobby group Australian Grape and Wine.

Tony Battaglene, the group's chief executive told the BBC that the situation may not improve any time soon.

"I wish the worst was behind us. Our bushfire season in Australia traditionally starts around December and will go on for three or four months. We have started very early this year, so it's very early days indeed."

"From the photos and the pictures you'll see, it doesn't seem like there's a lot more to burn, but I can assure you there is."

Australian Grape and Wine says Queensland and the Adelaide Hills region have been hit particularly hard.

In Queensland it predicts that production for 2020 is likely to be a fraction of last year's due to water shortages.

The fires have also potentially wiped out a third of wine production in the Adelaide Hills region, according to the area's industry association.

Of the region's 3,300 hectares of vineyards, around 1,100 hectares have been directly affected by the bushfires.

Producers don't just face the direct impact of the blazes but also smoke damage, or so-called "smoke taint".

Bushfire smoke can permeate the skin of the grapes as they ripen, causing wine to have an unpleasant smoky taste.

'Battle on... keep trying'

Geoff Weaver owns a vineyard at Lenswood, high in the Adelaide Hills, which was also damaged in December.

He told the BBC: "We've lost all our sheds and equipment. We've also lost about 30% of our vines."

Image copyright Geoff Weaver Wines Image caption Geoff Weaver Wines lost all of its sheds and equipment to fire in December

He said, for that third of his vines: "We've lost this year's crop, the 2020 crop. We'll also lose the 2021."

But Mr Weaver sent a defiant message to his fellow winemakers, telling them: "Battle on. Keep trying to make the best wine you possibly can and challenge the world markets with the best wines we can make in Australia."

That spirit of determination was echoed by James Tilbrook.

He said he'd been overwhelmed by how many people had rallied round to help rebuild his vineyard and winery.

"A mixture of anger getting angry about stuff that you shouldn't really get angry about, tears when you get upset about stuff but joy at the same time that you've got these little wins, and also faith in humanity that people are there to help."

Much of that support has come through the vineyard's Facebook page, with professionals from electricians to lawyers offering expertise, and materials, as well as people who just came along to help out.

"I've basically put out posts that have been shared and shared and shared and shared again. As a result we've had a lot of volunteers, we've had about a hundred so far."

"We definitely couldn't have done it without all these people."

It could have been any gourmet food fair, with lots of delicious things to eat.

The main hall at the Meadowlands Exposition Center, in New Jersey, was bustling with more than 6,000 attendees taking a look at 360 food and drink exhibitors from around the world.

The hundreds of products on show included everything from pizza bases made from cauliflower, to salsas, ice cream sandwiches, cider, beef empanadas (a Mexican pastry), Italian sorbets, gins, charcuterie, tequila, and even a range of biscuits infused with cannabis oil.

But this was no ordinary food and drink exhibition. For while there was a vast range on display, everything had one major thing in common - they were all certified kosher. Everything present conformed to kashrut, the Jewish dietary laws.

Image copyright Dave Gordon Image caption Numerous drinks companies were in attendance

The event at the end of last year was the 31st annual "Kosherfest", a two-day gathering that touts itself as "the world's largest and most attended kosher-certified products trade show".

While Jewish-owned companies were proudly in attendance, many of the firms who were present are not owned or run by Jews, but had still chosen to go kosher. These included businesses from Pakistan, South Korea, Sri Lanka and Italy.

With the number of people attending up 800 from the year before, and 300 new products on display, Menachem Lubinsky, chief executive of event organiser Lubicom, said that demand for kosher food was growing strongly among non-Jewish shoppers.

"Kosher food appeals to a more health-conscious consumer," he says. "It's like a new generation of kosher. It's different from those who have been there for many years, the basic kosher staples."

Image copyright Dave Gordon Image caption Kosherfest has now been held for 31 years

The centre of the world's kosher food sector is the US. For while only 2% of Americans are Jewish, some 7.5 million people, a study by the Quartz business news website found that 41% of all packaged food in the US is certified kosher.

Explanations for this include a perception that kosher food is cleaner or healthier, or people's desire for assurance than a product does not include potential allergens such as shellfish. It also offers certainty for vegans, such as in the example of Oreo cookies, which prior to their switch to kosher in the late 1990s contained lard (pork fat).

Global Trade

More from the BBC's series taking an international perspective on trade:

Led by growing demand in the US, the global kosher food market is predicted to increase to almost $60bn (£40bn) of annual sales in 2025, up from $24bn in 2017. Given those vast figures, it is not surprising that a growing number of food businesses around the globe are seeking kosher accreditation.

"I think firms are coming from the basis that you can't produce an ingredient anywhere in the world, and hope to sell it in the US, without being kosher," says Mr Lubinsky. "There's a significant market, and firms want a piece of it."

Image copyright Getty Images Image caption A kosher certified product that is marked "parve" contains no meat or diary

But what exactly is kosher food? While most people understand that pork and shellfish are non-kosher, kosher animals such as cows and lambs need to be ritually slaughtered with a sharp knife. Meanwhile, food products cannot contain both meat and dairy. And not all parts of the cow can be consumed.

All kosher rulings have to be carried out by trained rabbis from a kosher certification agency. Richard Rabkin, managing director of COR, the largest such organisation in Canada, explains that the process is taken very seriously.

"Some people have this mistaken impression that we go there and bless the food, and that's all it takes," he says. "No, it is more complicated than that.

"We have an initial conversation with a company and get an impression of what they're doing in the food, and take a look at all the ingredients, and find out whether it's kosher or not. Once we have a picture of that, then we inspect the facility itself... We are guarding against cross contamination.

"Once we ensure all of that, there's an inspection to make sure everything is followed according to kosher standards, and then certification's granted. [But], inspection isn't just time to time, it's an ongoing basis."

Image copyright Dave Gordon Image caption Elli Kriel runs a kosher business in the United Arab Emirates

Back at Kosherfest in New Jersey, Dakshin Thilina was representing Sri Lankan food group Nexpo Conversion, and its kosher dried coconut milk powder and coconut oil. He explains that unlike some of his company's rivals it doesn't use any sodium caseinate, a milk-derived food stabiliser.

"Without that component our products are lactose-free," he says. "And because they are non-dairy, kosher Jews can use them any time, alongside meat."

Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Kosher food has been transformed in recent decades, but old classics remain, such as brisket on rye (pictured), potato pancakes, bagels, donuts and cheesecakes

Another Asian firm in attendance was Dewan Sugar Mills from Pakistan, which makes ethanol for mouthwashes. "We wanted to tell people that there's nothing not kosher that ever comes into contact with what we make," says general manager Adnan Pirzada.

And there from Dubai was South African expat Elli Kriel who runs a kosher catering company - Elli's Kosher Kitchen. "I was producing kosher food for our family, and people started reaching out to me," she says. "Travellers in particular, moving through the city, needed kosher food.

"I used to invite them to eat in our house, but I realised, when more and more people began reaching out, that I was in a good position to offer kosher catering."

Mr Lubinsky says he is pleased to see kosher food branch out from the Jewish classics and "go upscale". "It's not your chopped liver and stuffed cabbage any more," he adds.

   US-China trade deal: Five things that aren't in it

The US and China have finally - after almost two years of hostilities - signed a "phase one" deal. But it only covers the easier aspects of their difficult relationship, and only removes some of the tariffs.

The biggest hurdles are still to come, and could stand in the way of a second phase agreement - one that would in theory remove all of the tariffs, bringing some much needed relief for the global economy, which is in the interests of all of us.

What's not in the phase one deal tells us where the flashpoints are in the US-China relationship - and what could derail the second round of negotiations.

So what didn't make it into the agreement?

1. Industrial subsidies and 'Made in China 2025'

The deal doesn't address Beijing's ambitious 'Made in China 2025' programme, which is designed to help Chinese companies excel and become world-class leaders in emerging technologies. It also doesn't address the subsidies that China gives its state-owned enterprises, says Paul Triolo of the Eurasia Group.

Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption What is Beijing planning with its "Made in China 2025" programme?

Washington sees "Made in China 2025" as a direct threat to its supremacy in tech, saying that Chinese companies have only caught up with American ones - at times outpacing them - because they get unfair and outsized assistance from the Chinese government in the form of subsidies.

These were amongst the thorniest issues the Trump administration had with China, but they've been pushed to the phase two process Mr Triolo says, along with "market access in sectors such as cloud services, cyber security and data governance issues".

Beijing maintains it doesn't unfairly subsidise these industries or companies, but the reality is China isn't going to give up dominance in these sectors so easily.

2. Huawei

The trade deal won't reduce US pressure on Huawei, the Chinese telecoms giant that has been caught in the crossfire of the trade war, with the US Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin saying the company isn't a "chess piece" in the negotiations.

That will disappoint both Huawei and the Chinese government which have been furious over how Washington has linked the company's fate to the relationship between the US and China.

The Chinese firm became a symbol of the US-China tech rivalry and Washington has been lobbying its allies - including the UK - to not use Huawei's 5G technology services in critical communications infrastructure, alleging it could be used by Beijing to spy on customers. Huawei has denied this and had hoped that if the US-China relationship improved, its fortunes would too.

Analysts tell me that's unlikely. With the signing of this agreement, there's a clear separation between national security and trade, and Huawei and other Chinese companies should still expect the pressure on them to continue. So expect more American export bans not just on Huawei, but on several more Chinese companies and increased US scrutiny on Chinese investments abroad.

3. Access for foreign financial services firms

While the agreement does talk about opening up market access for financial services firms, some analysts have said it doesn't go far enough to ensure they have equal market access.

China had already publicly said that it was opening up its financial services sector, and has recently allowed foreign companies to have a bigger stake in Chinese firms. But Beijing isn't giving up much by doing that, because China's financial services sector is now dominated by domestic digital payment players.

Even if US payment firms do have greater market access to the Chinese market, it's hard to see how they might be able to compete. Whether China sincerely applies its commitments to treat foreign and domestic firms equally will also be watched closely by the Trump administration, and this could be a potential area where the rapprochement could be derailed.

4. Enforcement and interpretation

The deal has a dispute resolution mechanism in place, which basically requires China - once a complaint has been made - to begin consultations with the US, with the onus on Beijing to resolve it.

But what the deal leaves out is "how the US is going to monitor enforcement," says Derek Scissors of the American Enterprise Institute.

"American firms don't like to report intellectual property theft," he told me."So in the first instance what mechanism is the US using to gather information on this. All that is in the document is consultations."

The deal also leaves out how the two sides will interpret these key aspects of the agreement. Already, there are signs of differences. Chinese state media has suggested the dispute resolution mechanism isn't dictated by the US - not entirely in keeping with Washington's messaging.

This could indicate that even though there is an agreement in place, Beijing might ignore it, as Dan Harris of the China Law blog points out.

"The problem isn't the law," he says. "It's that when something is important to China - some cutting edge technology that it wants - then those laws don't have any use at all."

5. Further reductions in tariffs

The deal doesn't include a definitive timeline on when the tariffs that are still in place will go down.

According to research from the Peterson Institute for International Economics, average tariffs on both sides are still up about 20% from pre-trade war levels - six times higher than when the dispute began. That means companies and consumers are still paying more.

Admittedly, the Trump administration has left the threat of tariffs in place as a stick to beat China with - in case Beijing doesn't keep to its commitments.

And there's always that risk, as China's hard line Communist Party mouth-piece the Global Times points out: "Can a preliminary trade agreement, reached during a period when China-US strategic relations are clearly declining, really work? Will it be replaced by new conflicts or further progress as negotiations continue?"

The potential for trade tensions to resume on both sides is still a very big possibility.

   Flybe: Viable business or destined to fail?

Just a year after being rescued, Flybe's future is again in doubt.

Some have blamed fundamental problems with the business model, others bad management, competitive pressures, unfair taxes, or the vagaries of the oil and currency markets. In truth, it's a combination of all these, and more.

The firm's boss Mark Anderson has told staff that the firm still has a bright future ahead of it.

But Flybe has been in financial turmoil for years, and there are arguments that if current investors Virgin Atlantic (49%-owned by Delta Air Lines), Cyrus Capital Partners, and Stobart Group, can't make it work, who can?

The government sees enough value in Flybe to (surprisingly, perhaps) help with a rescue. So, how did we get here? And, crucially, is good money just being thrown after bad?

When did Flybe's troubles begin?

The Exeter-based airline's problems did not just emerge this month. It has long-suffered from overcapacity and rising costs.

There was a profit warning in 2017, with higher maintenance costs blamed as a major part of the problem.

Another profit warning in 2018 said Flybe would sink to a £22m loss, with the airline saying falling consumer demand, a weaker pound and higher fuel costs were the cause.

Flybe, then listed on the stock market, saw its shares tumble 46% in a single day.

Nevertheless, then chief executive Christine Ourmieres-Widener said: "We continue to strengthen the underlying business and remain confident that our strategy will improve performance."

In November 2018, two weeks after that optimistic assessment, Flybe announced it was putting itself up for sale. The airline said it was "in discussions with a number of strategic operators about a potential sale" and could cut more flights.

Flybe was bought by Connect Airways - the consortium that includes Virgin Atlantic, Cyrus Capital and Stobart Group - in February last year.

Now a private company, the Flybe group is not due to file its next set of profit and loss figures with Companies House until 4 April. And these accounts will only deal with the airline's profitability in the period to 4 July, 2019.

But given Connect Airways went cap-in-hand to the government for help, it's safe to say that the airline's financial position has worsened.

What is Flybe's business model?

Flybe is a regional airline, which means it operates smaller aircraft and generally serves communities and airports that are too small to attract the big names in the aviation industry.

Against the likes of Ryanair or British Airways, Flybe is a minnow.

This is both a blessing and a curse.

Being able to reach the places that other airlines don't is seen as vital for regional connectivity. Exeter MP Ben Bradshaw went so far as to describe Flybe as a UK strategic asset. On some routes the competition is really only rail or ferry, not other airlines.

And in a country where costly infrastructure projects such as HS2 and Crossrail take an eternity to build, Flybe has provided a nimble solution to tough transport problems. For example, some 68% of Belfast airport flights, and 90% of Southampton's, are operated by Flybe.

The trouble is, Flybe can get "sandwiched" between the business model of budget airlines such as Ryanair and EasyJet, and the network carriers such as British Airways that use short-haul flights to connect with their long-haul services.

If Flybe's routes to secondary and tertiary locations prove successful, the bigger players are likely to move in, operating the services at lower costs.

It does not help that many Flybe routes are within the UK, where, the airline has long complained, it is at a tax disadvantage.

Air Passenger Duty (APD) is a levy paid on each leg of the journey within the UK - departure and arrival. For international flights, it is only paid on the outbound ticket.

APD is thought to cost Flybe more than £100m a year.

What do we know about the rescue?

Given that Prime Minister Boris Johnson has made improving "regional connectivity" a key part of his industrial plan for the UK, seeing a regional airline go bust probably would not have looked good.

For days after Sky News broke the story that Flybe was on the brink of collapse and had lined up an administrator, the company declined to say anything meaningful about its plight. Then it emerged that the Connect consortium was in talks with the government about a rescue deal.

Details remain sketchy, but this is what we know.

Flybe may get a deferral on its APD, and the government will review the whole duty structure

The Connect Airways consortium will inject another £30m into the business

There have been talks about a short-term loan to tie over Flybe until it is on a firmer financial footing

This has raised many unanswered questions. Why is a Conservative government propping up failing companies? Is it right to rescue Flybe when there was no help for Thomas Cook and other collapsed businesses such as Carillion? Does it disadvantage other airlines? Is there a breach of state aid rules? Also, isn't APD supposed to limit flying and help meet Britain's climate change targets?

How do rivals feel about the rescue?

There has been a mixture of outrage and concern among Flybe's rivals.

Willie Walsh, chief executive of British Airways' owner IAG, called it a "blatant misuse of public funds" that "constitute unlawful state aid". He has filed a complaint with Brussels.

EasyJet boss Johan Lundgren said that taxpayers cash should not be used to bail out a business with well-funded backers such as Virgin and Delta. And Ryanair said in a statement that the government should not "favour a financially profligate airline". Ryanair has threatened legal action against the government.

The Rail Delivery Group, which represents train operators, said any review of APD "that encourages more people to fly domestically would limit efforts to tackle the climate crisis".

The Chancellor, Sajid Javid, along with Business Secretary Andrea Leadsom and Transport Secretary Grant Shapps, have all been closely involved in the rescue plan.

The word from these departments, and also Number 10, is that the final terms of the rescue will be done in a fiscally responsible way that will neither neither breach state aid rules nor climate change targets.

The Prime Minister's spokesman said "there has been no state aid to Flybe," adding that "any future funding will be made on strictly commercial terms".

According to Mr Shapps: "The actions we have taken will support and enhance regional connectivity across the UK, so local communities have the domestic transport connections they rely on."

What is the future for Flybe?

Flybe has been through several restructurings over the past decade, suggesting there have been fundamental problems for years. The Connect consortium has not managed to knock the airline into shape in the relatively short time it has owned it. And many people believe that the government can provide only a short-term fix.

The government can't do much about global oil prices and currency swings. An economic slowdown in the UK and the rest of Europe will pile pressure on an already weak airline.

According to analyst John Grant, Flybe's fragmented network and relatively small number of daily flights means it is difficult to achieve critical mass and means the airline is exposed to short-term changes in market conditions.

He says: "Regional can be good; a closeness to customers, brand loyalty, minimal direct competition and a perception that high air fares are paid by all. The reality can be quite different; network fragmentation, numerous crew bases, high operational exposure and ultimately quite small catchment areas."

The acquisition by Virgin (and through it, Delta) will possibly help feed Flybe's passenger traffic onto these network carriers but it has clearly not made much of a difference yet.

One rumour is that the government considered extending so-called public service obligations to a number of Flybe routes that were particularly important to regional communities. That, in effect, means subsidising them - always a controversial move.

But until full details of what is planned are disclosed, analysts say it is difficult to know whether Flybe can be put on a firmer footing.

Threats of legal action could only delay matters. And one thing Flybe doesn't have is time.

   Collector pays UK-record £1m for rare coin

An Edward VIII sovereign has become the first British coin to be bought for £1m, the BBC can reveal.

The new owner, a private collector, described the chance to buy it and bring it back from the US as a "once in a lifetime opportunity".

The coin is one of a trial set of six which never went into mass production owing to Edward's abdication in December 1936.

It only has a face value of £1 but is now the country's most valuable coin.

The 22 carat gold sovereign - a type of coin which has not been struck for general circulation since 1932 - is just 22mm in diameter and weighs 7.98g making it just fractionally smaller and lighter than a pound coin.

Image caption The reverse side of the coin was designed by Benedetto Pistrucci

It was prepared for striking in January 1937, but the previous month the King abdicated in order to marry American divorcee Wallis Simpson.

Only the trials remained, but they were hidden from public view for decades. Edward, who became the Duke of Windsor, requested a set of coins but was refused by his brother, George VI.

Now, four of the set are with museums and institutions, with two in private hands. The latest owner, a sovereign collector who wished to remain anonymous, said: "When the opportunity came along, I felt I could not turn it down. It was a once in a lifetime opportunity.

"I'm aware that [£1m] is a lot of money for a coin, but if I did not secure it now, I'd not get the chance again."

Quirk of vanity

The coin was last sold for a then-record £516,000 to a US collector in 2014, revealing its status on both sides of the Atlantic.

What fascinates collectors and historians is not only its rarity, but also that Edward VIII was willing to break with a convention that went back centuries to Charles II.

This saw each monarch face the opposite direction to their predecessor. Edward preferred his left profile, partly owing to his hair parting, and insisted on the portrait facing, in effect, the wrong way.

"Edward VIII is quite a vain character. He insisted on facing the same way as his father, because he believed that was his best side," said Chris Barker, from the Royal Mint Museum.

George VI, who succeeded him, also showed his left profile, keeping to tradition as if Edward had not broken the sequence.

How the sale happened

How do you value a coin so sought-after and so rare? The Royal Mint, the Treasury-owned business which strikes coins for nations around the world, set up a service two years ago aiming to find and authenticate coins and precious metals.

Its state-of-the-art lab, at the Mint in South Wales, contains x-ray machines and other technology that can easily spot a fake.

This collector services division acted as the go-between for the sale, for a cut of the price. Its experts found that the coin could be for sale, contacted the collector of sovereigns, and effectively acted as a broker for the deal.

Rebecca Morgan, head of the service, said: "The Royal Mint has an unbroken record of minting for 1,100 years so we're uniquely placed to source historic, British coins for our customers.

"They can feel confident that it has been through the authentication checks and they have paid a fair price for it."

The Mint may have helped to secure a record sale for a UK coin, ahead of a Queen Anne Vigo five guinea coin, but it is still a long way short of the world record.

The flowing hair dollar coin, the first issued by the US government, fetched more than $10m (£7.5m) at auction in 2013.

   Flybe boss says government loan is not a bailout

  <text>
   The boss of Flybe has confirmed the airline is in talks with the government over a loan, but says the financial support would not constitute a bailout.

Mark Anderson told Flybe staff the firm had had a few "difficult days" this week but it still had "a great future".

He said the company's turnaround plan had started to work and that with more time it would be making a big profit.

Rival airlines have called for more details of the government's role in helping Flybe to be made public.

They argue that support for the troubled regional carrier may contravene competition rules.

Mr Anderson, whose address to staff was also carried over videolink and has been seen by the BBC, said the government recognised the airline's vital role in connecting far flung parts of the UK and wanted to help the firm thrive.

"We are in conversation with the government around a financial loan - a loan, not a bailout - a commercial loan, but that is the same as any loan we'd take from any bank," he said.

According to state aid rules the loan would need to either be short term and aimed at rescuing and restructuring the business or it would have to be provided on the same terms a private lender such as a bank would offer.

"The government will not lend if they do not believe there is a credible plan. No-one is going to throw good money after bad," Mr Anderson said.

'More money needed'

Mr Anderson said he wanted to address speculation over the firm's future.

He said the company had had "legacy issues" to deal with that had not been apparent to the group of investors led by Virgin Atlantic who bought the airline early last year.

Image copyright Flybe Image caption Mark Anderson addressed Flybe staff to explain events of the last few days

"Our shareholders invested an awful lot of money, believing they fully understood the state of the business they'd bought," he said.

"The reality… is that we were in worse shape than even the shareholders thought we were.

"We went into the summer very unresilient in terms of our operation, with a weak fleet, with a lot of gaps in terms of people flying our aircraft, with huge payments being made to people to get them to work extra hours."

A combination of higher costs, late flights, and compensation for delayed passengers meant the firm was losing money "hand over fist" for a time, he said.

"Three-quarters of the money the shareholders invested was gone before we even really started. That has hurt this business and more money is needed."

However, he said by the beginning of January Flybe's turnaround plan was working, with sales ahead of expectations.

"We are in a vastly different place than where we were six months ago," he said.

"We are not making millions of profit at the moment but if we stick to the plan, and what we have to do, we will," he said.

He admitted this week's news coverage had dented sales but said he believed customers would return quickly. But he said that there was a risk of a "self-fulfilling prophesy" if people kept talking the company down.

Fair competition

On Thursday, the boss of rival carrier Ryanair described the government's intervention to support Flybe as a "badly thought-out bailout of a chronically loss-making airline".

Michael O'Leary, sent a strongly worded letter to Chancellor Sajid Javid in which he argued any measures that were being put in place to help Flybe should be extended to other airlines.

"We must be treated the same as Flybe if fair competition is to exist," he wrote.

He said if that were not the case Ryanair would consider taking legal action. British Airways' owner IAG has already filed a complaint with the EU, arguing the rescue may breach state aid rules and has filed a Freedom of Information request for more details about the plan.

The government has not published the details of what it has discussed with Flybe, although it has said it is fully compliant with state aid rules.

The government's support is thought to centre on giving the airline extra time to pay about £100m of outstanding Air Passenger Duty (APD).

Flybe's owners Richard Branson's Virgin Atlantic, Stobart Group and Cyrus Capital have agreed to invest £30m into the airline.

Stobart Group said it would provide £9m of capital "with the funds drawn down only if required".

   Mukesh Ambani: Asia's richest man in $13bn ruling boost

Asia's richest man has scored two major wins in his ambition to dominate the Indian telecoms market.

The main competitors to Mukesh Ambani's Reliance Jio have been told they must pay the bulk of almost $13bn (£10bn) to the government in historical fees.

The country's top court rejected calls from older firms, including Vodafone Idea, to review the case.

Meanwhile, Reliance Jio has overtaken Vodafone Idea to become India's biggest mobile services operator.

The court ruling adds yet more financial pressure on India's telecoms sector, which has already been hit hard by a bitter price war.

After three years of price cutting, led by Mr Ambani, his company now has only two major competitors - Bharti Airtel and Vodafone Idea.

Vodafone Idea has been told it must pay about $3.9bn, while the ruling means Bharti Airtel is liable for $3bn. The charges relate to licence and spectrum fees that have accumulated over many years.

Reliance Jio, which is less than four years old, owes just $2m.

Vodafone has previously said the situation was "critical", while Bharti Airtel said an earlier court order cast doubt on "its ability to continue as a going concern".

Telecoms analyst Minakshi Ghosh believes the Supreme Court ruling threatens the future of Vodafone Idea, a joint venture of Britain's Vodafone and local operator Idea Cellular.

She told the BBC: "Airtel, I think, would be under pressure, but would be able to manage. The cause of concern will be Vodafone (Idea).

"Probably Vodafone will be the most affected and we will end up with a duopoly of Airtel and Jio, which is not very good for the industry."

At the same time, new figures from the Telecom Regulatory Authority of India showed Reliance Jio added more than 5.6m mobile subscribers in November.

That means it now has a total of almost 370m users, or more than 32% of the market.

The subsidiary of Reliance Industries launched in September 2016 offering cut-price phones and data plans.

Its entry into India's telecom sector triggered a major shake-up in the sector which saw most of its competitors shut down or merge.

   China's economic growth hits 30-year low

China's economy grew last year at the slowest pace in almost three decades.

Official figures show that the world's second largest economy expanded by 6.1% in 2019 from the year before - the worst figure in 29 years.

The country has faced weak domestic demand and the impact of the bitter trade war with the US.

The government has been rolling out measures over the past two years in an attempt to boost growth.

It comes after almost two years of trade tensions with the US - although hopes of a better relationship with America have seen improvements in manufacturing and business confidence data.

This week Washington and Beijing signed a "phase one" trade deal. However, analysts remain unsure whether those recent gains will continue.

In response to the lower growth rate, Beijing is now widely expected to roll out yet more stimulus measures.

The government has used a combination of measures aimed at easing the slowdown, including tax cuts and allowing local governments to sell large amounts of bonds to fund their infrastructure programmes.

The country's banks have also been encouraged to lend more, especially to small firms. New loans in the local currency hit a record high of $2.44 trillion (£1.86tn) last year.

Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption How the US-China trade war has changed the world

So far the economy has been slow to pick up, with investment growth falling to record low levels.

Historically, China has seen much stronger economic expansion, with the first decade of the 21st Century seeing double-digit percentage growth.

But - although that 6.1% growth rate is China's weakest expansion in almost three decades - it is much higher than other leading economies.

The US central bank, for example, has forecast that the American economy will grow by around 2.2% this year.

'The trade war may have actually helped the Chinese economy'

Analysis by Stephen McDonell, BBC China correspondent

For many countries, having the slowest GDP growth in three decades might cause panic - but not in China.

Softening domestic demand and US tariffs have eaten into growth - but some analysts argue that the trade war may have actually helped the Chinese economy.

This 6.1% GDP figure for 2019 is not only within the government's target range, but Chinese policy makers have for years been trying to gradually step down expectations.

They're trying to break away from the years of unsustainable breakneck growth which has trashed the natural environment and led to an explosion in unserviceable debt.

The government has instigated some stimulus measures to make sure the steam doesn't come out of the economy too quickly. But on bank loans, the crucial question will be - who gets access to the loans?

Will it be those building the "bridge to nowhere" vanity projects which have popped up in many regional cities?

Or will it be the promising new start-up enterprises which are seen as the future of modern Chinese development?

As part of the phase one deal, China pledged to boost US imports by $200bn above 2017 levels and strengthen intellectual property rules.

In exchange, the US agreed to halve some of the new tariffs it has imposed on Chinese products.

Speaking in Washington, US President Donald Trump said the pact would be "transformative" for the American economy.

Lawyers acting for ousted Nissan boss Carlos Ghosn have hit back after the car giant accused him of misusing the firm's money for events abroad.

Nissan said its joint venture with Renault spent €3.9m (£3.3m) on Mr Ghosn's personal expenses.

The events included a party at the Palace of Versailles and trips to Rio de Janeiro carnivals.

Mr Ghosn's lawyers said Nissan's investigation is biased and designed to publicly smear him.

They added that Nissan never interviewed him or his aide Greg Kelly, who also faces criminal charges in Japan.

Mr Ghosn fled from Japan to Lebanon on 29 December to escape charges of financial misconduct.

He later gave a news conference in Beirut in which he described his decision to abscond as the most difficult of his life.

He denies charges of financial wrongdoing in Japan, claiming the country's justice system is "rigged". Mr Kelly remains in Japan on bail.

Image copyright AFP Image caption Nissan claims Carlos Ghosn used company money for dinners at Paris's Marmottan Museum

The report, submitted by Nissan to the Tokyo Stock Exchange on Thursday, details "personal expenses of Mr Ghosn" which it claimed were "unrelated to corporate purposes".

These include:

Dinners at the Marmottan Museum in Paris

Guest entertainment at the Cannes Film Festival

Jewellery purchased at Cartier stores

It also claims Nissan paid $750,000 in advisory fees to Mr Ghosn's sister and that he used the corporate jet "for purposes that were highly likely unrelated to [company] business".

Nissan published a report into corporate governance at the firm after conducting an investigation which included examining "the misconducts by Mr Ghosn, Mr. Kelly and individuals who may have acted in concert with them".

Mr Ghosn defence team said: "This report confirms that Nissan's investigation was biased, lacked integrity and independence and was designed and executed for the predetermined purpose of taking out Carlos Ghosn."

Mr Ghosn and Mr Kelly are accused by Japanese authorities of under-reporting Mr Ghosn's compensation by more than $80m. Mr Ghosn has also been charged with aggravated breach of trust. Both men deny the charges.

   Travelex boss breaks silence 17 days after cyber attack

   Image copyright Travelex Image caption Tony D'Souza said it was "not appropriate" to discuss details of the attack.

The boss of Travelex has broken his silence about a cyber attack that forced its staff to use pen and paper and halted travel money sales at some banks and supermarkets.

The firm has released a number of short statements since cyber criminals held the firm to ransom on 31 December.

But in a video message on the firm's website, boss Tony D'Souza said the IT system used by in-store staff was working again.

However, other systems remain offline.

In a scripted video that was uploaded to a backup Travelex website, Mr D'Souza said the company had taken its systems down after the cyber attack on New Year's Eve.

However, while he said the system used by staff is now working, there was no word on when the firm's main UK website would be returned to service.

That means customers are still unable to order currency online, either from Travelex itself or through the network of banks that use its services, including Barclays, Lloyds, RBS, and the finance websites of Sainsbury's and Tesco.

Travelex had said little publicly since hackers held its systems to ransom by encrypting its digital files, reportedly demanding $6m (£4.6m) to unlock that data.

But Mr D'Souza said it was "not appropriate" to discuss details of the attack, adding that an investigation was ongoing. "To date, there is no evidence that any data has left the organisation," he said.

But the hackers, a gang called Sodinokibi, have told the BBC they gained access to the company's computer network six months ago and claim to have downloaded 5GB of sensitive customer data.

Dates of birth, credit card information and national insurance numbers are all in their possession, they said.

Travelex said it is working closely with the Metropolitan Police, which is leading the investigation into the attack.

Mr D'Souza said the the disruption had been "uncomfortable" for Travelex's partners and he apologised to customers for the "inconvenience".

He said the firm had been able to honour "the majority" of online orders placed by customers before 31 December, adding that only a "relatively small proportion" of its end customers used its website to order currency.

"One of the interesting things about our retail business is just how much of it might be described as walk-in," he said. However, he said: "I'm not trying to diminish the disruption that some of our customers had faced."

Mr D'Souza said Travelex had a "clear strategy" to restore the rest of its services. "We have made good progress in our recovery and I'm pleased to say our first customer-facing systems are now successfully live," he said.

The Northern Irish rock musician Cormac Neeson says having a child with Down's syndrome has changed his life in a "joyful and positive" way.

In 2014 Neeson was, in many ways, living the rock 'n' roll dream. His band, The Answer, had sold hundreds of thousands of records and had toured the globe with the likes of The Rolling Stones, The Who and AC/DC.

But the singer's world was shaken to the core when his wife, Louise, gave birth to a very premature baby at just 27 weeks.

"It was an unbelievably dark and troubled time," says Neeson.

Their son, Dabhog, was born weighing just 1lb 12ozs (0.8 kg) and was immediately taken into intensive care. He stayed in hospital in Belfast for the next four months.

"For a large portion of that time we weren't sure on a daily basis whether he was going to make it through," Neeson adds.

Two weeks into that time they had to deal with the news that Dabhog had Down's syndrome - a genetic condition that typically affects a person's learning abilities.

"That was something else that just added to the whole very intense experience."

Image copyright Cormac Neeson Image caption Dabhog underwent heart surgery aged one

Around that time The Answer were releasing an album.

"I would have to take myself away from the incubator for 20 or 30 minutes and do interviews to promote the album.

"I had to pretty much pretend I was in a place where I was comfortable releasing good time rock 'n' roll music. It was a complete collision course with where my head was actually at," Neeson says.

Dabhog did survive and was discharged from hospital, although he had to have surgery aged one to fix a hole in his heart.

The experiences have had a profound effect on Neeson's outlook on life and his music.

"Whenever the dust settled and Dabhog was home and his health started to turn and life settled down a bit I realised that creatively I was not in a place where I could genuinely write the kind of music we had spent the last 10 years writing," he says.

He went to Nashville where he worked with American songwriters and musicians to put together a new album. "The result was really a collection of songs that was so introspective and intense and so truthful that they really could only be part of a solo project.

"It's a world away from the stuff that I had spent my career making up till that point."

One of the songs, Broken Wing, is a tribute to Dabhog.

"It's a good opportunity to talk about Down's syndrome and normalise what Down's syndrome is, but also to celebrate my son for being the individual that he is," Neeson says.

He says he wanted to get over in the song that raising a child with a learning disability has a unique set of challenges, but "it's unique in a really great and powerful way".

Neeson says he also wrote the song to help new parents of children with Down's syndrome.

"I was kind of placing myself back in the hospital whenever we were told that Dabhog had Down's syndrome and I was thinking that if I'd heard this song back then I might have taken some comfort from it.

"If your child has Down's syndrome that is not what defines your child. Your child is unique and amazing like every other child. I've never met a person like my son, Dabhog.

"The joy that he brings into our lives is something that I could not have anticipated when we were just worrying day to day about his health and getting him out of that hospital alive."

The album's title, White Feather, is a reference to an incident early in Louise's pregnancy with Dabhog.

At around three weeks they were told it was as an ectopic pregnancy, when a fertilised egg is implanted outside the womb, often in a fallopian tube. The egg cannot then develop into a baby and the pregnancy has to be terminated due to the risk to the mother's health.

After taking Louise into surgery the doctors realised it was not an ectopic pregnancy, but said they would have to wait another two weeks before being able to scan for a heartbeat and confirm if the baby was still alive.

The night before the scan, Neeson went for a walk by himself in the hills near his hometown of Newcastle, County Down.

"A lot of soul searching went on. I said out loud, 'I need a sign'. At that point I was stopped dead in my tracks."

He had spotted a white feather in the trees. "In Ireland a white feather represents life," Neeson says.

The next day the scan revealed a "gigantic" heartbeat.

Dabhog is now five and in September started school, where Neeson says he has made friends and won certificates for being pupil of the week.

"Just to be able to experience our little boy thriving like that and being so communicative and being such a life-affirming character and for him to bring so much joy into our lives, it's a massively positive experience for us and we're thankful for that," Neeson says.

Dabhog now has a younger brother and Neeson has become an ambassador for the learning disability charity Mencap in Northern Ireland. Dabhog attended a Mencap centre in Belfast for specialist learning and early intervention support.

"Before my wife became pregnant with Dabhog I suppose my sole focus in life was essentially myself and I think you become much less selfish when you have a child," he says.

Looking back to 2014, he adds: "There are moments in your life when you don't know how you're going to get past these obstacles that are set, but you do.

"Whenever you come out the other side there's a real sense of victory and that's where we are at now."

   Bombshell: Charlize Theron on 'wrapping her head around' Megyn Kelly

There are two different types of bombshell in Bombshell.

The Oscar-nominated film depicts the 2016 sexual harassment scandal at Fox News, which led to the firing of the network's then CEO Roger Ailes and rocked the media industry.

But the film's title also refers to the female employees who were involved.

The right-wing news network is famous for hiring young, attractive and usually blonde anchors to front its broadcasts.

"The movie's title is clever, cleverness being its modus operandi," said the New York Times. "The story, after all, is about female employees who, with icy smiles and iron ambition, worked for a conservative political force who institutionalised the harassment of women."

Former presenter Gretchen Carlson was the first to blow the whistle on Ailes, claiming she was fired from the channel for refusing his sexual advances.

Several other women then came forward, among them the high-profile anchor Megyn Kelly, to add their names to the list of women he abused.

Charlize Theron has been widely praised for her portrayal of Kelly in Bombshell, which has netted her a nomination for best actress at the Oscars.

Playing a real-life person, especially one who's still active and high-profile, can be a particular challenge for an actor. But when it came to researching the role of Kelly, Theron explains: "I didn't meet her, by choice.

"Listen, the whole thing is pretty overwhelming," she continues. "It took me a while to wrap my head around playing her for many reasons. But I think the biggest one is that she's so well known. And it's contemporary, it's of this moment, and whether you like her or not, you know her face, you know what she sounds like, and there was really no getting around that."

Theron has been praised by critics not only for her acting performance, but also for her physical likeness to Kelly, which was achieved with the help of prosthetics from make-up artist Kazu Hiro.

"The transformation is so authentic, so on point, it's unnerving," said Empire's editor Terri White.

"The first thing you notice about her deep-dive performance as Megyn Kelly is that you don't see Theron at all," agreed Peter Travers in Rolling Stone. "Through voice, posture, wardrobe, and the genius prosthetic make-up, Theron is Kelly."

Theron, who also co-produced the film, explains she wrestled with Kelly's politics before she agreed to the role.

"There are things she's said in the past that have bothered me," Theron says. (Kelly's previous controversies include her defence of people dressing in blackface as a character for Halloween and her comments about Santa Claus being white.)

"But the more I zeroed in on what the film was, [I realised] it wasn't a Megyn Kelly biopic, it's about a year-and-a-half at Fox, and she was a part of many other women who experienced this thing and then ultimately succeeded in doing something that was thought of as impossible.

"And so once I narrowed it down to that, it became easier for me to make it about that, and whether I have issues with her or not, she was part of something that will I think be a historical marker for women's rights."

Ailes was fired from Fox News as a result of the allegations, receiving $40m (£31m) in severance pay. He died a year later, aged 77. Several women who filed lawsuits against him received damages from Fox News.

The fact that the Ailes scandal pre-dated #MeToo makes it all the more significant, as the climate was not what it became a year later, when allegations against movie mogul Harvey Weinstein sparked the movement which would bring down several big-screen heavyweights.

Image copyright Getty/Lionsgate Image caption Roger Ailes (left) died in 2017. He is played in the film by John Lithgow (seen with Theron)

The film largely keeps things focused on the scandal and doesn't venture into being a study of the goings on at a right-wing news channel.

"Is Bombshell hard enough on Fox News? Difficult to gauge, because it's so much more focused on the internal culture than the product they put out in the world," wrote Alison Willmore in Vulture.

"The film presents familiar figures as waxlike caricatures," she wrote, adding: "When it comes to Trump, the movie is oddly unspecific about the role Fox News played in the election."

But perhaps that doesn't matter, given how resonant the film feels as a result of its focus on sexual harassment.

"This conversation is happening in real time, and I think without that this movie wouldn't have the power that it does," acknowledges Theron.

"It was really strange to make the film and to slowly see these things all kind of unravel. I remember sitting in the make-up trailer and watching male actors talk negatively about this movement, that they thought was dangerous and was excluding men and was over-correcting, and it was infuriating.

"The Harvey [Weinstein] thing happened and that was really big, and when the tapes of the women were released, I think that's when we realised that we were part of telling a story which was somewhat the origin story of this whole movement, and we didn't know that before."

How does she respond to those suggestions that it has led to over-correcting? "I mean, listen, I feel like, in context, when you really look at it at from 30,000 feet in the sky, what's happened to women in toxic workplaces for years and years, a little over-correcting is the least we can do," Theron says.

Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Charlize Theron was nominated for best drama actress at the Golden Globes earlier this month

Considering Kelly isn't well known in the UK, and Fox News isn't consumed widely, is Theron aware that Bombshell could be a harder sell for British audiences?

"Totally, of course, we have all of those conversations," she replies. "But then you realise that you guys have the linchpin, Rupert Murdoch," she says, referring to Fox's ultimate chief, who also owns British newspapers including The Times and The Sun. "So I think that's enough information, that's all you need to know.

"You don't really need to know anything about Fox," she continues. "Because this is such a non-partisan... this is not a political film, it's not about Fox per se, really it's just the time and the place in the world. This is something which I think is reflected in so many different workplaces.

Before we leave, we ask which news outlets Theron consumes herself.

"CNN," she replies initially. "But I also like to have varied news sources, I watch a lot of right-wing political shows and news programmes because I think it is important for us to see how the other guy is talking. So there's never been a part of me that's just like 'don't want to see it, don't want to hear it, only want to get what I believe'.

"I think it's hard to have any kind of real conversation about real issues unless you really know where the other person is coming from, what ground they're standing on. You have to be willing to listen. I think a lot of the time we just want to state what we believe and the importance of that, and we don't listen enough."

Bombshell is released in the UK and Ireland on Friday 17 January.

   Oscars 2020: 9 snubs, surprises and snippets you may have missed

   Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Oscars 2020: Who's been nominated?

This year's Oscar nominations have reignited the row about representation in Hollywood, as well as making some high-profile omissions.

Here are nine of the big talking points from this year's shortlists.

1. 'Congratulations to those men'

Image copyright Sony Image caption Greta Gerwig directing Meryl Streep in Little Women

No women have been nominated for best director. That means that over the past 10 years, 49 out of the 50 best director nominees have been men.

That's despite huge support for Greta Gerwig for her scintillating adaptation of Little Women, while there were also hopes for Lulu Wang (The Farewell) and Marielle Heller (A Beautiful Day in the Neighborhood).

It is an extremely competitive category this year, but that won't do much to soothe those who say that the Oscars still aren't doing enough for equality, despite the reforms made to its voting membership in recent years.

After announcing the shortlist, actress Issa Rae pointedly remarked: "Congratulations to all those men."

A comment welcomed widely on social media.

Skip Twitter post by @jenelleriley THE FAREWELL and HUSTLERS were two truly original, excellent and PROFITABLE films both written and directed by women and their total shut-out is discouraging. #Oscars — Jenelle Riley (@jenelleriley) January 13, 2020 Report

2. Going backwards on diversity?

Image copyright AFP Image caption Lupita Nyong'o missed out on a nomination for Us

Nineteen of the 20 acting nominees this year are white - the highest number since the #OscarsSoWhite outcries of 2015 and 2016, when there was a total whitewash.

After three actors of colour won golden statuettes in 2019, this year the main films in the awards race have largely not been those that are telling diverse stories with diverse casts.

The Oscar nominations come a week after the Baftas announced an all-white line-up of acting nominations. Embarrassingly for Bafta, the one black star up for an Oscar is a Brit.

That is Cynthia Erivo, who made her name across the Atlantic on Broadway and is now nominated for playing slave-turned-abolitionist Harriet Tubman in Harriet.

But there is still much unrest that this year's list is not more diverse. There was evidently no space for Lupita Nyong'o for Us, Golden Globe winner Awkwafina for The Farewell, or Eddie Murphy for Dolemite Is My Name, to name but three. In fact, all three films were shut out entirely.

Meanwhile, some are pointing out that there was room to nominate Scarlett Johansson twice, for best actress for Marriage Story and best supporting actress for Jojo Rabbit - her first Oscar nominations.

Skip Twitter post by @TonyRevolori I used to defend the #OscarNoms because it starts in the studio system making Women and POC films to be able to be nominated. You can’t nominate what isn’t made. But this year there are plenty of incredible movies that deserved the nominations over Non-POC. Just Disappointing. — Tony Revolori (@TonyRevolori) January 13, 2020 Report

Skip Twitter post by @WendellPierce The Academy still has a way to go to reflect the work of all artists and not just those with the resources for a stronger publicity campaign. Even though that’s all Award shows are: publicity campaigns. #OscarNoms — Wendell Pierce (@WendellPierce) January 13, 2020 Report

3. Erivo in line for an EGOT

If Erivo does win, she will become only the second black best actress winner - after Halle Berry in 2002.

Not only that, but at 33 she will become the youngest person to become an EGOT - the winner of Emmy, Grammy, Oscar and Tony Awards - according to the Los Angeles Times.

She won the Tony in 2016 for starring in The Color Purple on Broadway, and the Grammy for the show's cast recording. She got a Daytime Emmy for a cast performance on NBC's Today (although the paper points out some people don't count Daytime Emmys towards an EGOT).

And she has two shots at an Oscar this year. As well as being up for best actress, she is nominated for best song for writing Stand Up, which appears in Harriet.

4. Jenny from the block is blocked

Image copyright Reuters Image caption Jennifer Lopez at the Golden Globe Awards

Jennifer Lopez won't make it from "the block" (that's somewhere in the Bronx) to Hollywood Boulevard on Oscars night.

She had been among the favourites to be nominated for best supporting actress for Hustlers, the true story of a ring of women who drugged and swindled rich men at strip clubs.

It would also have been rare recognition for a Latin American performer.

Instead, Kathy Bates - who had been a relative outsider - got the nod for Clint Eastwood's controversial film Richard Jewell. It's her fourth nomination, and her first since 2003.

Still, at least all the praise J-Lo has received for her role probably means she won't have to face the indignity of adding to her tally of 10 nominations for the Golden Raspberries - for the worst films of the year.

5. Rocketman fails to launch

Image copyright Reuters Image caption Sir Elton John is nominated, but Taron Egerton is not

After Rami Malek won best actor for playing Queen singer Freddie Mercury in Bohemian Rhapsody last year, it looked like Taron Egerton might follow that path with a best actor nomination for playing Sir Elton John in Rocketman.

But despite winning a Golden Globe last week, the British actor has missed out on an Oscar nod. In fact, it looks like he was edged out by a fellow Welshman, with Jonathan Pryce sneaking in to get his first Oscar nomination at the age of 72 for The Two Popes.

Rocketman got one nomination - for Sir Elton himself and Bernie Taupin for best original song for (I'm Gonna) Love Me Again - but missed out on categories like costume design, make-up and hair, and sound mixing, for which it had been tipped.

6. Beyonce's Spirit is broken

Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Beyonce at the Lion King premiere

Not only have the Oscars missed the chance to get Jennifer Lopez on the red carpet, but they have also passed up the opportunity to give Beyonce a ticket.

She was thought likely to be in the running for best song for Spirit from The Lion King, but it was not to be.

That category also contained a hope for a song called Glasgow, sung by rising Irish star Jessie Buckley in Wild Rose. That too was shut out. But she'll surely get to the Oscars in an acting capacity before too long.

7. Frozen II frozen out

Six years ago, Frozen won two Oscars - best animated feature and best song for Let It Go (of course).

This time, the sequel is nominated for best song, for Into the Unknown - but it's been left out in the cold when it comes to the best animation category.

That category does include Toy Story 4, Missing Link, How to Train Your Dragon: The Hidden World, I Lost My Body and Klaus. The latter is a Netflix Christmas animation, and its inclusion is a big surprise.

8. The return of the Oscar darlings

Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Al Pacino pictured the last time he was nominated for an Oscar, in 1993

A number of past Oscar favourites have been welcomed back into the fold.

Al Pacino now has nine career nominations, with the latest coming for his turn as union king Jimmy Hoffa in Martin Scorsese's The Irishman. It's his first since 1993, when he was up twice (and won for Scent of a Woman).

Sir Anthony Hopkins has his first nomination since 1998, and his fifth overall, for The Two Popes.

Tom Hanks was once Mr Oscar and has won twice, but remarkably his nomination for A Beautiful Day in the Neighborhood is his first nod since 2001 (for Cast Away).

Renee Zellweger is favourite to scoop best actress for playing Judy Garland in Judy - her first nomination since she was shortlisted for three years in a row from 2002-04.

And Charlize Theron is nominated for Bombshell - her first nod since North Country in 2006.

9. A country for old men

Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Al Pacino pictured at the Critics' Choice Awards on Sunday

In the best supporting actor category, the average age of the nominees is 71. Brad Pitt is the baby at 56, and will go up against Hanks (63), Joe Pesci (76), Al Pacino (79) and Sir Anthony (82).

Even across both male acting categories, the average age is 60, whereas the average age of nominated actresses is 40. Which ties in with previous research that Hollywood prefers its female characters to be younger than its men.

US singer Billie Eilish has become the youngest ever artist to write and record a theme song for the James Bond film series at the age of 18.

Cary Joji Fukunaga, director of No Time To Die, said Eilish is now one of "a chosen few" and that her song will "echo for generations to come".

Dame Shirley Bassey, Duran Duran, Lulu and Madonna are just some of the acts to have provided songs for the franchise in the past.

Both Adele and Sam Smith won Oscars for their musical contributions to the last two 007 films - Skyfall and Spectre respectively.

While we wait to hear what Eilish's song sounds like, here is a personal rundown of the best tracks to feature in the series to date - and the worst.

Top five Bond themes

5) Nobody Does It Better, Carly Simon

Film: The Spy Who Loved Me, 1977

Highest UK chart position: 7

Sample lyric: "Like heaven above me, the spy who loved me, is keeping all my secrets safe tonight..."

Lyricist Carole Bayer Sager deserves extra plaudits for sneaking the title of Roger Moore's third Bond film into Marvin Hamlisch's lush and elegant composition.

The Oscar-nominated song has been covered many times over the years by such artists as Sophie Ellis-Bextor, Aimee Mann and Dame Julie Andrews.

4) Diamonds are Forever, Shirley Bassey

Film: Diamonds are Forever, 1971

Highest UK chart position: 38

Sample lyric: "Diamonds are forever, hold one up and then caress it. Touch it, stroke it and undress it..."

John Barry and Don Black's tune may have been considered too near the knuckle by producer Harry Saltzman, but it still won the duo an Ivor Novello songwriting award.

One of Black's proudest moments was being told by director Steven Spielberg how highly he rated the track.

3) Live and Let Die, Paul McCartney and Wings

Film: Live and Let Die, 1973

Highest UK chart position: 9

Sample lyric: "If this ever-changing world in which we're living makes you give in and cry, say live and let die..."

This is a dynamic masterclass in pulse-quickening rock, courtesy of Beatles producer George Martin.

Subsequently covered by Guns N' Roses, it was the first James Bond theme to be nominated for the best original song Oscar.

2) We Have All the Time in the World, Louis Armstrong

Film: On Her Majesty's Secret Service, 1969

Highest UK chart position: 3

Sample lyric: "Every step of the way will find us, with the cares of the world far behind us..."

Written by John Barry for George Lazenby's solitary outing as Bond, this poignant ballad was one of Louis 'Satchmo' Armstrong's final recordings.

The track - which only charted in the UK after being used in a 1994 beer commercial - is not played over the opening credits, appearing instead during a romantic montage midway through the movie.

1) Goldfinger, Shirley Bassey

Film: Goldfinger, 1964

Highest UK chart position: 21

Sample lyric: "He's the man, the man with the Midas touch..."

Told by John Barry to create a song about a villain in the style of Mack The Knife, Leslie Bricusse and Anthony Newley came up with the only Bond track everyone remembers.

Fans of US sitcom Frasier may remember Kelsey Grammer's reluctant rendition of the song in the final episode of the Cheers spin-off's sixth season.

Worst five Bond Themes

5) For Your Eyes Only, Sheena Easton

Film: For Your Eyes Only, 1981

Highest UK chart position: 8

Sample lyric: "You see what no-one else can see, and now I'm breaking free..."

Nominated for the best song Oscar, Bill Conti's dreary ballad was rewritten at the producers' request. (In the original version, the film's title appeared much later in the track.)

To date, Scottish performer Easton is the only singer to physically appear in a Bond title sequence.

4) All Time High, Rita Coolidge

Film: Octopussy, 1983

Highest UK chart position: 75

Sample lyric: "All I wanted was a sweet distraction for an hour or two..."

This is a deathly dull MOR dirge, hastily written by Evita lyricist Tim Rice and perfunctorily performed by Coolidge for Roger Moore's sixth outing as 007.

The same year brought an equally undistinguished tune from Lani Hall, recorded for Sean Connery's "rogue" Bond film Never Say Never Again.

Image copyright Getty Images

3) The Living Daylights, A-ha

Film: The Living Daylights, 1987

Highest UK chart position: 5

Sample lyric: "Hey driver, where we going? I swear, my nerves are showing..."

According to composer John Barry, working with the Norwegian pop trio on the gloomy theme for Timothy Dalton's first 007 film was like "playing ping-pong with four balls".

The Bond producers reverted to a more traditional, Bassey-esque number when they came to make Licence to Kill with Gladys Knight two years later.

Image copyright Getty Images

2) The Man with the Golden Gun, Lulu

Film: The Man with the Golden Gun, 1974

Highest UK chart position: N/A

Sample lyric: "He has a powerful weapon, he charges a million a shot..."

One of the few 007 themes to miss the charts completely, this John Barry/Don Black composition also features some of the most blatantly suggestive lyrics in the franchise.

Alice Cooper's 1973 album Muscle of Love features a song of the same name, which the rock star wrote for the film only to have it rejected.

Image copyright Moviestore Collection/Shutterstock Image caption Toby Stephens, Rosamund Pike, Madonna and Pierce Brosnan in Die Another Day

1) Die Another Day, Madonna

Film: Die Another Day, 2002

Highest UK chart position: 3

Sample lyric: "I guess I'll die another day, it's not my time to go..."

Mixed by Paris-based producer Mirwais, Madonna's attempt to give a dance vibe to the 007 franchise is an overcooked calamity.

The US singer also made a cameo appearance in Pierce Brosnan's fourth and final Bond film, playing a fencing instructor called Verity.

‘You, Me and the Big C’ presenter Deborah James, who was diagnosed with stage four bowel cancer in 2016, has revealed she is currently ‘free’ of the disease.

She told BBC Radio 5 Live’s Tony Livesey: “It’s a miracle... it does not mean that I’m necessarily cancer free for life but I didn’t even think I’d ever get to this point”.

James, 38, began co-presenting You, Me and the Big C with Lauren Mahon and 5 Live presenter Rachael Bland in 2018, and their frank discussions about cancer have won widespread praise.

Rachael Bland died in September 2018 at the age of 40, two years after being diagnosed with breast cancer.

Line of Duty and The Irishman actor Stephen Graham has set up his own production firm to give a platform to under-represented voices and stories.

Graham founded Matriarch Productions with his wife, actress Hannah Walters.

"We hope to develop stories that give young and first-time writers and directors an opportunity," he said.

He told Variety the new company would "try to develop good stories that will be a broader representation of the cultural aspects of our society".

The Liverpudlian star is adding the production role to his status as one of Britain's most sought-after actors. His credits span Hollywood hits like Pirates of the Caribbean and gritty TV dramas including The Virtues and ITV's current White House Farm.

He told Variety he wants to improve representation both in front of and behind the camera.

"We want to give opportunities to people who wouldn't otherwise," he said. "For example, someone who would never be [considered for a role as] the head of a department, but is an amazing make-up artist. So, to then say, 'How about you step up on this one?'."

The film and TV company will be based in Leicestershire, where the couple live.

In November, Graham told Hunger magazine he worried that a lot of budding actors were falling through the cracks because they could not afford to go to drama school.

"My fear is how many people lose out on those opportunities because they are not given the opportunity to at least have a go at it, which is very sad," he said.

Graham, who grew up admiring the work of Merseyside dramatists like Alan Bleasdale and Alan Clarke, added that storytellers from different regions and backgrounds also need to be given a chance.

"I feel it's not just with acting though, I feel it's with the directors, and predominantly the writers. I think writers from those areas need to be given the opportunity to tell their stories and stories that they know."

The chief executive of the Recording Academy, which organises the Grammy Awards, has been removed from her position just 10 days before this year's ceremony in Los Angeles.

Deborah Dugan was placed on administrative leave following an allegation of misconduct, the Academy said in a statement.

Dugan had replaced former chief executive Neil Portnow, who caused controversy in 2018 when he suggested female artists should "step up" if they wanted to be recognised at the Grammys.

She was the Academy's first female president and, in an interview published this week, called her role "the best job on the planet".

In a statement, the Recording Academy said: "In light of concerns raised to the Recording Academy board of trustees, including a formal allegation of misconduct by a senior female member of the Recording Academy team, the board has placed Recording Academy president and CEO Deborah Dugan on administrative leave, effective immediately.

"The board has also retained two independent third-party investigators to conduct independent investigations of the allegations."

It continued: "The board determined this action to be necessary in order to restore the confidence of the Recording Academy's membership, repair Recording Academy employee morale, and allow the Recording Academy to focus on its mission of serving all music creators."

Board chairman Harvey Mason Jr will step into Dugan's role until the investigation reaches a conclusion.

He sent an email to members of the Academy on Thursday, assuring them that "the Grammy Awards and all related activities will go forward as planned".

Dugan is a former lawyer and record executive who previously ran Bono's charity Red, which works to combat Aids and other diseases in Africa.

According to Variety magazine, the 61-year-old had met with resistance in her attempts to modernise the Recording Academy, with one unnamed source calling her removal a "coup".

The 62nd Grammy Awards are due to take place at Los Angeles' Staples Center on Sunday 26 January, hosted by Alicia Keys.

Performers on the night will include Billie Eilish, Camila Cabello, Bonnie Raitt, the Jonas Brothers, Demi Lovato and Rosalía.

Actor Derek Fowlds, known to millions for playing Bernard Woolley in Yes Minister, has died at the age of 82.

He also played sergeant-turned-publican Oscar Blaketon in ITV police drama Heartbeat for 18 years, and was "Mr Derek" on the Basil Brush show in the 70s.

The actor died at Royal United Hospital in Bath on Friday morning, after having suffered with pneumonia.

"You couldn't have met a nicer person ever" said his assistant Helen Bennett.

"He was just a wonderful man and I will miss him terribly."

She added: "He was the most beloved man to everybody who ever met him, he never had a bad word to say about anybody and he was so well respected, adored by everyone."

Basil Brush himself said he is "so desperately sad" at the news, describing the late star as "my best friend forever". Fowlds worked on the BBC children's television show as a presenter between 1969 and 1973, where he replaced Rodney Bewes.

Image caption The BBC's Yes Minister also starred [L-R] Nigel Hawthorne and Paul Eddington

Gavin and Stacey star and former EastEnders actor Larry Lamb paid tribute to his "dear old colleague".

Skip Twitter post by @larrylamb47 A dear old colleague passed on today ..Derek Fowlds was a truly lovely man and a fantastic actor .. my condolences to all his family and friends...a REAL legend LL — Larry Lamb (@larrylamb47) January 17, 2020 Report

Piers Morgan described him as "a terrific actor &amp; by all accounts, an incredibly nice man" and Baby Driver director Edgar Wright tweeted his respects, pointing to "a classic scene in British comedy" in which Jim Hacker explains to Sir Humphrey and Bernard the importance of the newspapers and who reads which.

Born in south London, Fowlds trained at Rada before making his West End debut in The Miracle Worker.

He appeared in several films, including Hotel Paradiso, and then TV shows including Z Cars in 1968 and a couple of episodes of the Liver Birds between 1969 and 1971.

Fowlds was the last of the remaining original Yes Minister stars, following the earlier deaths of Sir Nigel Hawthorne and Paul Eddington, who he appeared alongside in the BBC political satire from 1980 to 1984, and in Yes, Prime Minister from 1986 to 1988.

He appeared in Heartbeat for its entire run of 18 years, first as a local police sergeant, then running the post office after the character retired from the force, before running a pub.

Jason Durr, who starred alongside Fowlds in the police drama series said he was "a great actor and a kind, intelligent man" and that he would "treasure the memories" of working with him.

'Marathon not a sprint'

Fowlds released his autobiography, A Part Worth Playing, in 2015 in which he recalled how he started to act "just for kicks".

"Growing up the thought of acting as a living never crossed my mind. I wanted to be a footballer or sportsman," he said, adding he started acting in school plays.

"I enjoyed mucking about the stage," he wrote.

He told the tale of how in his first play a child, he got his sword stuck up another actor's skirt and "I heard the sound of audience laughter for the first time in my life, and I was just knocked out."

Speaking to The Stage publication last year, he offered some advice to any budding actors.

"My advice to young actors today would be to work hard whenever you can, but also to have fun and, whatever you do, don't take yourself too seriously.

"Always remember that an acting career is a marathon, not a sprint, and I wish all of today's actors good luck with it."

Fowlds was married twice; first to Wendy Tory and then later to Blue Peter presenter Lesley Judd.

He is survived by sons Jamie and actor Jeremy.

   Dementia: Does heading a football cause the disease?

The Scottish Football Association is set to impose a ban on under-12s heading the ball in football training.

It comes amid growing fears that regular heading of a ball increases the risk of footballers developing dementia, and dying from the disease.

What is the evidence that they are at risk?

What happens to the brain when you head a ball?

A football weighs almost half a kilogram, and scientists have calculated that it can strike a player's head at speeds up to 128km/h.

When a ball strikes the head the brain, which floats within the skull cavity, bounces against the skull's back wall, causing bruising.

A 2018 study by the University of British Columbia found that blood levels of proteins associated with damage to nerve cells increase after heading the ball.

A single header is unlikely to cause any significant damage, but over an extended period the combined effect might lead to problems.

What evidence is there of an increased dementia risk?

Image copyright PA Media Image caption Jeff Astle's death was linked to repeatedly heading the ball

The issue hit the headlines in 2002 following the death of former West Brom and England player Jeff Astle at the age of 59.

Mr Astle had been diagnosed with early onset dementia. A re-examination of his brain in 2014 found he had died from chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE). That is a brain condition normally linked to boxing which has been linked to memory loss, depression and dementia. It has been seen in other contact sports.

A coroner ruled that Mr Astle's brain had been damaged by years of heading heavy leather footballs.

In February 2017, researchers from University College London (UCL) and Cardiff University published a study based on post-mortem examinations of the brains of six former players which found signs of CTE in four cases.

Prof Huw Morris, of UCL, told the BBC at the time: "We saw the sorts of changes that are seen in ex-boxers, the changes that are often associated with repeated brain injury. So really for the first time in a series of players we have shown that there is evidence that head injury has occurred earlier in their life, which presumably has some impact on them developing dementia."

Then last year, a study by Glasgow University found former professional footballers are three-and-a-half times more likely to die of dementia than people of the same age range in the general population.

However, there is no definitive evidence that heading a ball does cause dementia. That would require long-term research.

Why is it difficult to prove a link?

The causes of dementia are complex and it is likely that the condition is caused by a combination of age, lifestyle and genetic factors.

Physical trauma to the brain is certainly a factor, but an unhealthy lifestyle, such as smoking, drinking too much alcohol and being overweight are also known risk factors.

Teasing out how all those factors might come into play is immensely difficult.

What research is under way?

The London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine (LSHTM), Queen Mary University of London and the Institute of Occupational Medicine have launched a study of 300 former professional footballers.

The plan is to put the ex-players, aged between 50 and 85, through a series of tests designed to assess their physical and cognitive capabilities.

Data will also be gathered on the players' careers in the game and lifestyle factors.

This will allow comparisons between defenders and centre-forwards and other players who tend to head the ball less often.

The test results will be compared with those from a general population study known as the 1946 Birth Cohort, which has monitored the ageing process in a group born in that year.

Lead researcher Prof Neil Pearce, from LSHTM, said: "We don't know much about the risks from concussion in football, and we know almost nothing about the long-term effects from heading the ball repeatedly.

"This study will provide, for the first time, persuasive evidence of the long-term effects on cognitive function from professional football."

   It has been a remarkable year of promise in medical science - from inventing ways of treating the untreatable to reversing paralysis and keeping the brain alive after death.

Image copyright Fonds de dotation Clinatec Image caption Thibault was able to move his arms and legs when in the exoskeleton

"It was like [being the] first man on the Moon," said 30-year-old Thibault.

He was describing the moment he was able to take his first steps since being paralysed in a fall two years ago.

He can now move all four of his paralysed limbs with a mind-controlled exoskeleton suit.

His movements, particularly walking, are far from perfect and the robo-suit is being used only in the lab.

But researchers say the approach could one day improve patients' quality of life.

Meanwhile, nerves inside paralysed people's bodies have been "rewired" to give movement to their arms and hands.

Patients in Australia can now feed themselves, put on make-up, turn a key, handle money and type at a computer.

A unique drug made for just one girl with unprecedented speed

Image copyright Boston Children's Hospital Image caption Mila had untreatable Batten disease until doctors designed a medicine just for her

Mila Makovec's doctors have performed a seemingly impossible feat - a girl with a deadly brain disease has been given a unique drug that was invented from scratch just for her and all in less than a year.

She was diagnosed with fatal and untreatable Batten disease.

The eight-year-old's medical team in Boston performed whole-genome sequencing - a detailed interrogation - on Mila's DNA, her genetic code, and uncovered a unique mutation that was causing her disease.

Having seen the fault, the researchers thought it might be possible to treat it.

They designed a drug, tested it on Mila's cells and on animals in the laboratory and won approval to use it from the US Food and Drug Administration.

Drugs normally take about a decade and a half to get from the laboratory, go through clinical trials and get to patients.

The US team got there in a year.

Mila is now having far fewer seizures, although she is not cured.

Gene-silencing drugs arrive

Image copyright Sue Burrell Image caption Sue Burrell no longer has severe bouts of pain

A new class of medicine - called gene silencing - has shown its ability to reverse previously untreatable diseases.

A gene is part of our DNA that contains the blueprint for making proteins, such as hormones, enzymes or raw building materials.

But our DNA is locked away inside a cell's nucleus and kept apart from a cell's protein-making factories.

So our bodies use a short strand of genetic code, called messenger RNA, to bridge the gap and carry the instructions.

Gene-silencing drugs kill the messenger.

Sue Burrell no longer has bouts of severe pain caused by her acute intermittent porphyria.

And Vincent and Neil Nicholas are both taking gene silencing medicines for a disease called amyloidosis.

Viruses to the rescue

Image copyright Jo Carnell Holdaway Image caption Isabelle Carnell Holdaway is taking a cocktail of viruses to fight dangerous bacteria in her body

Isabelle Carnell Holdaway's life was saved by an experimental cocktail of viruses.

The teenager's body was being attacked by deadly and seemingly untreatable bacteria and she was given less than a 1% chance of survival.

She had big, black, festering lesions forming on her skin where the infection was taking hold.

And she ended up in intensive care when her liver started failing, with large colonies of bacteria forming in her body.

But doctors at Great Ormond Street Hospital attempted an untested "phage therapy", which uses viruses to infect and kill bacteria.

Phage-therapy never became mainstream medicine and the field was eclipsed by the discovery of antibiotics, which are much easier to use.

But now phage-therapy is having a resurgence due to the rise of superbugs that are resistant to antibiotics.

Isabelle's case could be the first of many.

A new approach to cancer

Image copyright Royal Marsden Image caption Charlotte Stevenson was treated with a tumour-agnostic drug

Charlotte Stevenson, a two-year-old from Belfast, was one of the first patients to benefit from a "revolutionary" new class of cancer drugs.

Tumour-agnostic drugs do not care where the cancer is growing in the body as long as it has a specific genetic abnormality inside.

The first, called larotrectinib, has been approved for use across Europe.

It is designed to target tumours with a genetic abnormality known as an NTRK gene fusion.

They can be found in Charlotte's sarcoma as well as some brain, kidney, thyroid and other cancers.

Meanwhile...

Cancer immunotherapy has reached a huge milestone.

The medicine uses a patient's own immune system to fight cancer and is a story we have followed closely.

Now more than half of patients are surviving a deadly skin cancer (melanoma) that was considered untreatable just a decade ago.

Ten years ago just one in 20 patients would live for five years after being diagnosed with late-stage melanoma. Most would die in months.

It has been an extraordinary and rapid transformation in care.

A first drug to slow dementia?

Image copyright Getty Images Image caption A pharmaceutical company says it has developed the first drug to slow Alzheimer's disease

A US pharmaceutical company says it has developed the first drug to slow Alzheimer's disease.

The drug, called aducanumab, is an antibody that clears toxic proteins that build up in the brain.

The announcement in October was a massive surprise, as the firm Biogen had written off the drug in only March this year.

Then it reviewed the evidence to show that those taking the highest dose did benefit and retained more memory and language ability and were better at day-to-day tasks such as cleaning, shopping and doing laundry.

If the drug is approved, which is not guaranteed, it would be one of the most significant moments in modern medicine.

A new type of dementia

Meanwhile, experts think they have found a new form of dementia and millions may have been wrongly diagnosed.

Dementia is a symptom found in many diseases of the brain and memory loss is the most common feature.

Alzheimer's disease is the most common form of dementia and others include vascular dementia, dementia with Lewy bodies, fronto-temporal dementia, Parkinson's disease dementia, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis.

Now "limbic-predominant age-related TDP-43 encephalopathy" or more simply "Late" has been added to the list.

Separating twins

Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption The battle to separate Safa and Marwa

One of our most followed stories of the year was the separation of two conjoined twins.

Safa and Marwa were born joined at the skull and they had never been able to see each other's faces.

There are no official figures for how often this happens, but one estimate says craniopagus conjoined twins are born once in every 2.5 million births.

Most do not live longer than a day.

To separate them required multiple surgeries, months of hard work and the expertise of hundreds of hospital workers.

Pig brains partially revived four hours after death

Image copyright Getty Images Image caption The findings could lead to new treatments for brain damage

The line between life and death became fuzzy in 2019.

Pig brains were partially revived four hours after the animals were slaughtered.

The study showed the death of brain cells could be halted and that some connections in the brain were restored.

The feat was performed by rhythmically pumping a synthetic blood around the decapitated brains.

The surprise findings challenge the idea that the brain goes into irreversible decline within minutes of the blood supply being cut off and could lead to new treatments for brain damage and disorders.

However, there were no signals from the brain that would indicate awareness or consciousness.

A new tool to manipulate DNA

Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Prime editing allows precise changes to be made to DNA

A new way of editing the code of life could correct 89% of the errors in DNA that cause disease.

The technology, called prime editing, has been described as a "genetic word processor" able to accurately re-write the genetic code.

It is a bit like pressing Ctrl-F to find the bit of text you want to change, then pressing Ctrl-C and Ctrl-V to copy over the new text (or the command key if you're a Mac user).

There are some 75,000 different mutations that can cause disease in people and the researchers say prime editing can fix nearly nine in 10 of them.

It has already been used to correct damaging mutations in the lab, including those that cause sickle cell anaemia and Tay-Sachs disease (a rare and fatal nerve condition).

Giving people a voice again

Image copyright Alamy Image caption Electrodes read the electrical activity in the brain

Scientists have developed a brain implant that can read people's minds and turn their thoughts to speech.

First an electrode is implanted in the brain to pick up the electrical signals that manoeuvre the lips, tongue, voice box and jaw.

Then powerful computing is used to simulate how the movements in the mouth and throat would form different sounds.

This results in synthesised speech coming out of a "virtual vocal tract".

It is not perfect.

If you listen to this recording of synthesised speech:

You can tell it is not crystal clear (the recording says "the proof you are seeking is not available in books").

The team at the University of California, San Francisco says the technology could help people when disease robs them of their ability to talk.

E cigarettes do help smokers quit

Image copyright Getty Images Image caption There have been some 50 vaping and e-cigarette-related deaths in the US this year

Vaping has been under intense scrutiny this year.

More than 2,400 people have needed hospital treatment, and there have been 50 deaths, in the US from "e-cigarette or vaping product use-associated lung injury".

Meanwhile, a teenage boy nearly died after vaping caused a catastrophic reaction in his lungs.

But experts have continued to stress vaping is safer than smoking tobacco and this year came proof that vaping helps smokers quit.

A trial, in the New England Journal of Medicine, found 18% of smokers who used them to quit remained smoke-free after a year, compared with 9.9% of those using traditional nicotine-replacements.

   Hernia mesh implants used 'with no clinical evidence'

   Image caption Roseanna Clarkin is now registered as disabled, after complications following her hernia mesh repair

"Too many" types of hernia mesh implants are being used on NHS patients with little or no clinical evidence, the BBC has been told.

New data shows more than 100 different types of mesh were purchased by NHS Trusts from 2012 to 2018 in England and Scotland, leading to fears over safety.

The meshes can cut into tissue and nerves, leaving some people unable to walk, work or care for children.

The regulator MHRA said there was a clinical need for the devices.

The new figures were taken from the responses of 56 of the 159 NHS Trusts that replied to a Freedom of Information request by the BBC's Victoria Derbyshire programme.

Currently, hernia mesh devices can be approved if they are similar to older products, which themselves may not have been required to undergo any rigorous testing or clinical trials in order to assess their safety or efficacy.

'Children want their mum back'

Hernia repair is one of the world's most common surgical procedure.

In England, around 100,000 such operations are performed each year, the majority using mesh. Many go well.

But the Victoria Derbyshire programme has heard from nearly 300 people who have experienced complications - including chronic pain, infections and organ perforations.

International guidelines estimate one in 10 patients will experience "significant chronic pain" following a mesh repair.

Image caption Roseanna says her children want their "fun mum back"

Roseanna Clarkin, from Glasgow, is now disabled. She had to give up her job due to complications after her repair.

She says she was initially told by doctors the pain was "in her head", and wanted to end her life because "nobody was listening".

It was only after seeing the programme's coverage of the mesh scandal that she discovered it had been used on her.

Aged 36, she said she was no longer able to look after her children as she had before.

"My kids wrote a letter saying they want their fun mum back," she said, breaking down in tears.

"My husband said he married a wife and became a carer. I shouldn't be living the life I'm living."

'Tested on rabbits'

There is a lot of secrecy surrounding the approval of hernia mesh, with even doctors unable to access the clinical data.

Prof Carl Heneghan, a medical device expert at the University of Oxford, explained that in some cases devices have only been required to be tested on animals - such as rabbits - for a short period of time, with the mesh being implanted and left in for several days.

"If there's no remaining immune reaction, you pass the test," he added.

Image caption Prof Carl Heneghan is calling for the NHS to "immediately" stop using types of device that have "no evidence attached to them whatsoever"

Prof Heneghan described these tests as "completely inadequate" as they can't test for pain.

And he said there was "no chance" that the more than 100 types of device used on the NHS were all individually supported by medical evidence because there had not been 100 randomised trials in this area of medicine.

He has called for the NHS to "immediately" stop using those that have "no clinical evidence attached to them whatsoever" and said ideally trusts should only use two or three devices where the benefits are clear.

Image caption An example of the mesh devices used

Hernia mesh implants are meant to be permanent but, when necessary, can be removed in some patients.

But of the patients the Victoria Derbyshire programme spoke to, most said they had been told there were no trained removal surgeons - or that they had been told removing the mesh could lead to further serious issues.

The programme has learned that one man died years after he developed an infection following his hernia mesh repair.

The hospital said in a letter to his wife that the mesh "could have been a cause of the infection".

One of the many causes of death given was chronic abdominal-wall infection.

'Hard as stone'

The BBC has also seen a leaked promotional video, probably for the medical community, funded by Ethicon - one of the biggest mesh manufacturers in the world.

In the footage, made over a decade ago, a surgeon is shown discussing how some older varieties of mesh can become "hard as stone" after only one year inside a patient and can cause damage to the body and chronic pain.

But the product featured is still being sold by Ethicon, and used by the NHS in England and Scotland.

In a statement, Ethicon did not comment on the video, but said it stood by the safety and performance of all its mesh products.

It also stressed the importance of looking at all clinical and scientific data before drawing conclusions about a device.

'Monitor for evidence'

Currently the use of mesh for vaginal repairs is suspended for most women in England, pending the outcome of a government review.

Its head, Lady Cumberlege, has said any recommendations made when it is published in March will also be relevant for hernia mesh.

No vaginal mesh implants have been carried out in Scotland since the chief medical officer announced a halt in 2018.

The director of devices at the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA), Graeme Tunbridge, told the BBC: "The benefits and risks of using mesh for hernia repair have been considered in detail by clinicians and the professional bodies who represent them.

"We continue to monitor and review evidence as it becomes available and will take any appropriate action on that basis."

Mr Tunbridge said he recognised the system "does need strengthening" and said new legislation on medical devices would take effect from May 2020.

This will include strengthening the requirements on manufacturers to ensure that sufficient clinical evidence is in place for their products.

The Royal College of Surgeons of England said: "Our duty is to explain the options and risks to patients, so they can decide what the best course of action is for them."

It is campaigning to improve regulation and monitoring of new devices and implants.

A Department of Health and Social Care spokesperson said: "On the rare occasion where a patient has suffered as a result of a mesh procedure, we are taking steps to improve patient safety - including improving how we listen to patients and how the system learns when concerns are raised."

   Image copyright Getty Images Image caption The researchers want to study speakers of many different languages

There are differences in the way English and Italian speakers are affected by dementia-related language problems, a small study suggests.

While English speakers had trouble pronouncing words, Italian speakers came out with shorter, simpler sentences.

The findings could help ensure accurate diagnoses for people from different cultures, the researchers said.

Diagnostic criteria are often based on English-speaking patients.

In the University of California study of 20 English-speaking patients and 18 Italian-speaking patients, all had primary progressive aphasia - a neuro-degenerative disease which affects areas of the brain linked to language.

It is a feature of Alzheimer's disease and other dementia disorders.

Brain scans and tests showed similar levels of cognitive function in people in both language groups.

But when the researchers asked participants to complete a number of linguistic tests, they picked up obvious differences between the two groups in the challenges they faced.

'Easier to pronounce'

"We think this is specifically because the consonant clusters that are so common in English pose a challenge for a degenerating speech-planning system," said study author Maria Luisa Gorno-Tempini, professor of neurology and psychiatry.

"In contrast, Italian is easier to pronounce, but has much more complex grammar, and this is how Italian speakers with [primary progressive aphasia] tend to run into trouble."

As a result, the English speakers tended to speak less while the Italian speakers had fewer pronunciation problems, but simplified what they did say.

English is a Germanic language while Italian is a Romance language, derived from Latin along with French, Spanish and Portuguese.

The researchers, writing in Neurology, are concerned that many non-native English speakers may not be getting the right diagnosis "because their symptoms don't match what is described in clinical manuals based on studies of native English speakers".

The San Francisco research team says it now wants to repeat the research in larger groups of patients, and look for differences between speakers of other languages, such as Chinese and Arabic.

"We hope that such studies will advance our understanding of the brain science underlying language and language disorders, raise awareness of health disparities in dementia treatment, and ultimately improve care for all patients," said Prof Gorno-Tempini.

   NHS to pioneer cholesterol-busting jab

A twice-a-year injection that reduces bad cholesterol to protect the heart is to be pioneered by the NHS in England.

Already, millions of people take daily statin pills to cut their cholesterol.

But later this year, a "ground-breaking" large-scale clinical trial will offer NHS patients a new form of medicine, gene silencing, in an injection called inclisiran.

Health Secretary Matt Hancock said the initiative could save 30,000 lives during the next decade.

Why is cholesterol a problem?

Bad cholesterol (officially called non-high-density lipoproteins cholesterol) can build up inside the walls of blood vessels, making them narrower and increasing the risk of having a heart attack or stroke.

A bloodstream-tussle takes place between "bad" cholesterol which dumps fatty material in the arteries and good cholesterol taking it away.

What is the new drug?

It is called inclisiran and it is given by injection every six months.

It is part of a new form of medicine called gene-silencing.

Inclisiran does not modify our DNA, but it controls the instructions the body gets.

It does this by "silencing" the PCSK9 gene, which results in the liver absorbing more "bad" cholesterol from the blood and breaking it down.

The first gene-silencing medicine was approved for NHS use last year for a relatively rare disease, hereditary trans thyretin-mediated amyloidosis.

How big an impact could inclisiran have?

Trials presented at the European Society of Cardiology last year showed it could cut bad cholesterol levels in half within weeks.

Prof Kausik Ray, who led those trials, from Imperial College London, says this gives it "enormous" potential.

And the Department of Health and Social Care says it would prevent 55,000 heart attacks and strokes each year for every 300,000 patients treated.

Who will be offered the drug?

The drug is not yet a licensed medicine, but a deal between the NHS and the pharmaceutical company means patients will be access the drug later this year as part of a large-scale clinical trial.

NHS patients who have not had a heart attack or stroke but are at high risk of having one will be invited to take part.

About 40,000 people might be eligible.

Inclisiran will also be assessed for more routine use next year based on evidence from previous trials.

At the moment - because of the way decisions on health are devolved within the UK - the announcement applies only in England.

What is special about this trial?

The NHS has described this collaboration between the health service, drug company Novartis and researchers as "ground-breaking".

"It is certainly innovative, exciting and a step-change in the way we do clinical trials," Prof Martin Landray, who will lead the trial from the University of Oxford.

Inclisiran is a drug people could potentially take for decades so it is essential to be able to monitor the long-term risks and benefits of taking the drugs.

Will this replace regular statins?

Statins are a cornerstone of heart medicine that are taken by millions of people in the UK.

They work by lowering levels of bad cholesterol.

However, some patients have such high cholesterol that it is still at dangerous levels even with statins.

And studies have shown they do not work well enough in roughly half of patients.

There are many types of statin and some patients could be on the wrong one. Or patients may be forgetting to take their daily pill.

It is some of these issues that having two injections a year might help with.

What do the experts say?

Prof Naveed Sattar, from the University of Glasgow, said: "Doctors are excited by inclisiran and the potential to 'vaccinate' against high cholesterol in some patients.

"However, many would also like to see longer term safety data from ongoing trials and to be told the cost of this new drug before they consider implications for care."

Prof Jacob George, from the University of Dundee, said: "Whilst inclisiran has not yet been assessed by the European Medicines Agency or the FDA [US Food and Drug Administration], giving patients access to these innovative new medications within the safety confines of a large-scale trial is welcome news."

And Dr Riyaz Patel, clinical lead for cardiovascular disease prevention at Barts Health NHS Trust, said: "This as a really exciting announcement that changes the way we bring new medicines to patients earlier and [will] also propel the NHS and the UK as a world leader in this sort of clinical research.

"It is certainly a welcome step forwards to get exciting new drugs to patients quickly and safely."

   Miscarriage can lead to 'long-term post-traumatic stress'

One in six women who lose a baby in early pregnancy experiences long-term symptoms of post-traumatic stress, a UK study suggests.

Women need more sensitive and specific care after a miscarriage or ectopic pregnancy, researchers say.

Toni Edwards-Beighton, 36, says she felt she was losing her mind after a miscarriage in 2016.

"I felt my grief was wrong because it wasn't a real baby - but I was in complete shock," she says.

Warning: Some readers may find part of this article distressing

Toni and husband Matt, from Leicester, had been told their baby had no heartbeat at 12 weeks, before she miscarried naturally at home in the bathroom.

But she didn't expect to bleed heavily for eight days and then have to go through painful contractions.

"I thought I was going mad," she says.

"I had no information about what what would happen to me or what I could expect to see."

Panic and anxiety

In the end, something "recognisable and the size of a palm" fell between her legs in the middle of the night.

When she called the hospital the following day, they told her to "bring the pregnancy tissue in and we'll get rid of it".

"It wasn't 'tissue' to me, it was our baby," Toni says.

In the weeks that followed, she started to panic about everything, especially their daughter who was four at the time.

"I worried she was going to die - I could see her falling to the ground."

Months later, Toni's GP diagnosed her with PTSD (post-traumatic stress disorder) and offered her counselling - but she didn't go because by that time she was pregnant again.

"The following nine months were awful - I was convinced I'd lose my baby again," she says.

Toni and Matt now have two daughters, Phoebe who is eight and Willow who is two.

In the study of 650 women, by Imperial College London and KU Leuven in Belgium, 29% showed symptoms of post-traumatic stress one month after pregnancy loss, declining to 18% after nine months.

Most had been through an early miscarriage before 12 weeks - while the rest had had an ectopic pregnancy.

The women, who attended three London hospitals - Queen Charlotte's and Chelsea, St Mary's, and Chelsea and Westminster, completed questionnaires about their feelings over the course of a year.

One month following their loss, 24% had symptoms of anxiety and 11% of depression.

This reduced to 17% and 6% after nine months, the study in the American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynaecology found.

Facts about early pregnancy loss

One in four pregnancies ends in miscarriage in the UK - with most happening early before 12 weeks

There are 250,000 miscarriages every year and 10,000 ectopic pregnancies

Miscarriage is the loss of a pregnancy during the first 23 weeks

An ectopic pregnancy is one that develops outside the uterus, or womb

Dr Jessica Farren, specialist registrar and clinical fellow at Imperial College London, said miscarriage could be a very traumatic experience.

"For some women, it's the first time they have experienced anything beyond their control.

"These can be profound events which stay with you."

Even though these losses are at a very early stage, "women are looking for validation for them", Dr Farren says.

Being told it's "only a bag of cells" is not always helpful.

Among a control group of women who had healthy pregnancies, 13% had symptoms of anxiety and 2% of depression one month after giving birth.

'Need for change'

The study recommends that women who have miscarried are screened to find out who is most at risk of psychological problems.

Counselling and support will help many women, but those with symptoms of PTS need specific treatment if they are going to recover, the research says.

This can range from cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) to medication, and should be given by a qualified professional.

An earlier, smaller study from 2016 found that early pregnancy loss could trigger symptoms of post-traumatic stress.

"For too long, women have not received the care they need following a miscarriage and this research shows the scale of the problem," says Jane Brewin, chief executive of miscarriage and stillbirth charity Tommy's.

"Miscarriage services need to be changed to ensure they are available to everyone and women are followed up to assess their mental wellbeing with support being offered to those who need it, and advice is routinely given to prepare for a subsequent pregnancy."

   Japan has marked Coming of Age Day, a national holiday in which those who turn 20 take part in ceremonies that officially welcome them into adulthood.

On the second Monday of each January, those that have turned 20 in the previous year take part in ceremonies in city halls and public spaces to mark the age of adulthood.

Participants in this year's Coming of Age Day are seen below in Tokyo Disneyland in Urayasu, an eastern suburb of Tokyo.

As part of the ceremony, women dress up in beautiful and colourful kimonos and men wear traditional Japanese dress or a suit and tie.

The age of adulthood in Japan was set in 1876, but in 2018 the government enacted a bill that will lower the age to 18, to take effect in 2022.

The biggest change will be that Japanese couples will no longer need parental consent to get married.

Currently, males over the age of 18 and females 16 and over can marry - but only with the say-so of their parents.

As part of the lowering of the adulthood age, revisions have been made to more than 20 laws, including on nationality and on certain professional qualifications such as being a chartered accountant.

Members of the governing Liberal Democratic Party say lowering the legal age of adulthood will help revitalise an ageing society with a falling birth-rate.

In 2015, the government lowered the voting age from 20 to 18.

After 2022, some laws will remain the same.

Eighteen-year-olds in Japan will still be banned from drinking alcohol, smoking, gambling and adopting children: they will still have to wait until they turn 20.

Liam Wong is a graphic designer and game developer turned photographer who has captured the nocturnal world of Japan's capital city, Tokyo.

Wong's pictures draw on his work as a video game designer and some of his own software techniques, creating an off-world vision of the city.

"I want to take real moments and transform them into something surreal, to make the viewer question the reality depicted in each photograph," says Wong.

Wong grew up in Edinburgh, playing video games before studying his art at Abertay University in Dundee, where he made his first video game in 2009 with some friends.

Some years later, while working on the game Far Cry 4 at the software house Ubisoft, he developed an interest in photography as he travelled to different events.

"I became fascinated by buildings, shapes, compositions and symmetry, and my initial visits to London and Paris made me increasingly aware of how each city has a different feeling, often dictated by the architecture," says Wong.

Ahead of his first visit to Japan in 2014, Wong purchased a new camera and planned to explore the city. But it was the next year when he found himself in Tokyo during the rain.

"The city came to life," says Wong.

"It took on a different persona. It was like being inside the worlds created by Syd Mead and Ridley Scott in Blade Runner or Gaspar Noe in Enter the Void."

Since then he has spent a few years capturing the streets of Tokyo at night, the results now published in his first photography book, TO:KY:OO.

Legend associates Guinevere with Knucklas Castle and there was a plan to flood the Teme valley as a reservoir in the 1930s. I took my photo of the valley, made a mirror image to create the lake and blended that with the Lady of Shallot as imagined by Waterhouse. In Tennyson's poem, she was only allowed to see reality in a mirror but fell in love with the passing image of Lancelot, Guinevere's lover. She died of exposure drifting lonely down the river past the castle, where Lancelot and the court of Camelot had gathered."

"There isn't really any way to describe the intensity of the fires."

Gabriel Kam's family home was recently destroyed by the bushfires which are sweeping across Australia.

Since September at least 24 people have died and the fires have destroyed more than 1,500 homes across the country.

"You don't think you'll actually lose everything until it's already happened," the 16-year-old tells Radio 1 Newsbeat.

"The shock will never fully set in."

Image copyright The Sydney Morning Herald Image caption Gabriel and his family tried to stop the fire but say they were at the "mercy" of nature

Gabriel's village, Balmoral, is about a two-hour drive south of Sydney.

It was first hit by the bushfires on 19 December. Two days later they struck again - that's when his home was destroyed.

Image copyright The Sydney Morning Herald Image caption Gabriel is 16 and lost his home

His family has followed advice of firefighters to clear small trees or any shrubbery that might catch alight but Gabriel says "there wasn't a lot we could do" to prepare for what was coming.

"You know it's coming. But at the end of the day, you're completely at the mercy of mother nature... you're helpless."

Image copyright Gabriel Kam Image caption Gabriel's home, where he lived with his parents, had been in the family for 20 years

He says their house was "destroyed in an instant" and there was no time to protect anything except their two cats and the clothes on their back.

Gabriel and his family are now staying close by with family friends.

"One thing you'll hear from a lot of firefighters is that this fire felt like it was alive... It completely encapsulated our house.

Image copyright Gabriel Kam Image caption The fires effortlessly melted through thick glass in the house

"We had double-laminated glass, which you would need to hit with a sledgehammer several times to break. The fire shattered straight away.

"When we came back to the wreckage there were pools of molten glass on the ground.

"We had furniture outside, it disintegrated so quickly that it left imprints of where the furniture was on the wall... anything inside the house is unrecognisable."

Image copyright The Sydney Morning Herald Image caption Firefighters have described the fires as sounding "like a jet engine"

"We almost got hit again," explains Gabriel.

"The only way this fire is going to stop is through lots of continuous hard rain. And rain is not coming to Australia anytime soon, unfortunately."

Image copyright Getty Images Image caption It's thought more than 500 million animals have been killed in the fires

Part of the relief efforts have come from international donations including a fundraiser for fire services in New South Wales, which has raised more than A$20m (£10.6m) in just 48 hours.

Gabriel has started fundraising for his family and local area and says getting support from all over the world is "really heart warming".

"People who don't necessarily need to care are still helping as much as they can because we are all human.

"The international community needs to understand what's happening in Australia.

"It's not going to stop anytime soon... No-one has been untouched."

Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison has called up 3,000 reserve troops to help as more strong winds and hot weather are predicted in the areas affected.

He was recently heckled during a visit to Cobargo in New South Wales, only a few hours away from Gabriel's house, by people who said the government hadn't done enough to help communities.

Gabriel agreed that "there's a sense of frustration", but says there's "an overwhelming sense of togetherness".

"A lot of this is happening when there could have been preventative measures.

"There's also a bond to support those who have lost things to the fire though."

Image copyright Gabriel Kam Image caption Bushfires rage outside Gabriel's home, before it was destroyed

Despite 20% of the village reportedly losing their homes to the fire, Gabriel says he's hopeful the community will be able to "come back stronger than we've ever been".

"We've had people we never met before come up to us and say, 'If you need a place to stay, you can stay at our place. If you need any clothes, we have a bunch we can give you'.

"We will get through this as a community and as friends together, and we will help each other rebuild."

As animals try to recover from bushfires which have ravaged Australia, wildlife services in New South Wales have taken to the skies to help wallabies.

The marsupials' food sources and habitats have been burned in the fires, so authorities are airdropping over 2,000 kg of carrots and sweet potatoes from helicopters.

Elsewhere in the state, communities and rescue centres have helped kangaroos, camels, horses and alpacas to survive.

But they're the lucky ones - many more animals have died in the fires, and in some cases the animals have had to be put down because their burns are too severe.

   Mac Miller sounds 'at peace' on posthumous album

Before Mac Miller died in 2018, he was working on an album called Circles.

The songs were being finished with the help of songwriter and producer Jon Brion, who went on to complete the album after Mac's death.

The rapper's family decided to release the album, which is out today, saying in an Instagram post that it's a "complicated process that has no right answer".

There can be concerns over whether putting out someone's music after they've died is the right thing to do, with fans worrying about the impact it might have on artist's legacy.

"I think sometimes the families try and capitalise on the music in a way that's not what the artist would've wanted", says 26-year-old Henry Dean.

He's a photographer and Mac Miller fan, and he worked with the rapper a few years ago on a magazine shoot. He spoke to Radio 1 Newsbeat at a free event to celebrate the UK release of the new album.

Image caption Henry is pictured here with some of his art of Mac

"Posthumous music is a murky area. I'm always sceptical of whether it's being handled right. Obviously, I don't know Mac's inner circle so I can't judge.

"Artists have banks of thousands of songs and not all of them are meant to come out, so I'm hoping everything on this album is stuff that he was actively planning on releasing."

In their post on Instagram, Mac's family said: "We simply know that it was important to Malcom for the world to hear it"

"The look on his face when everyone was listening said it all."

After the launch event in east London, fans seemed pleased with the result.

Image caption Paris, Lauren, Ray and Simone were excited to hear Mac Miller's new album

"It sounded perfect, it was very Mac Miller," says 23-year-old fan Paris.

"You could tell it was something he would've wanted to come out had he been here."

Paris' friend Lauren agrees.

"I was a bit worried it was going to be Mac's voice on someone else's songs, because it wasn't finished by him. Having listened, it was a very Mac album all the way through.

Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Mac Miller was 26 when he died from an accidental overdose

Roisin O'Connor is the music correspondent for the Independent. She was invited to listen to the album by the music producers who worked on it.

"Hearing them talk, it was made very clear that the family had given their blessing for the album to be released," she says.

"It wasn't just scraps of material, it was intended to be an album. He'd completed a lot of it before his death - it was final touches. To release it was almost like fulfilling his wishes."

She says that while posthumous music releases can be treacherous territory, Circles feels like a complete body of work from Mac himself.

"It's him at his creative peak. He sounds at peace, and philosophical about getting through each day."

"It was the moment I realised 'wow ... my great-granddad was Nelson Mandela'!"

Pumla Mandela is recalling the day, in 2013, when she read a poem at her great-grandfather's memorial service.

The former South African president is - for most of the world - a symbol of triumph over oppression. But for 26 year-old Pumla he was also family.

She sat down with Radio 1 Newsbeat to share memories of the man many South Africans still call Madiba - his clan name which has become used by the wider public as a term of endearment.

The poem Pumla read at the memorial said, "you are lodged in our memories, you tower over the world like a comet."

But, as you might expect, most of her lasting memories are more low key.

"He was the man who was always reading newspapers or that we'd have lunch with with.

"I'd be having conversations with my younger cousins and he'd always be silently listening and observing.

"We always thought he pretended to have hearing problems. He would pick and choose. Sometimes you'd have to speak loudly and sometimes you'd be speaking softly and he'd just input.

"He was a disciplinarian. He was very strict."

Nelson Mandela spent 27 years in prison for fighting for better rights for black people in South Africa. The apartheid system in place at the time meant they were denied many of the rights granted to the white minority there.

The law ended as he became the country's first black president.

His family tree is extensive - Pumla says she doesn't "have enough fingers" to count his great-grandchildren now.

But she still gets plenty of questions: "People would always want to know what it was like to have this great man as my grandfather."

It's 30 years next month since Nelson Mandela was released from prison - he became president in 1994.

But, today, South Africa still has more than its fair share of issues.

A higher proportion of black South Africans have historically lived in poverty compared with Asian and white South Africans.

In 2015, nine out of 10 people living in poverty were black.

It also has one of the highest murder rates in the world.

Image caption What does Pumla think her great-grandfather would make of his country today?

So what would Nelson Mandela make of 2020 South Africa?

"I know he wouldn't be 100% happy but I also know he predicted a lot of what is happening right now," says Pumla.

"He'd be unhappy with the level of unemployment, gender-based violence and the state of leadership in our country."

It's possibly for those reasons that social media debates about Mandela's legacy often fires up. There are those in South Africa who believe Nelson Mandela negotiated a deal to end apartheid which was too favourable for white people.

A lot of the debate is about owning land - the people who own private land remain largely white.

Pumla's home is littered with photos of her great-grandad. There's one with him and her when she was in primary school and there's another with her family and Michelle Obama.

She's missed out on some of those big moments though.

"My mum was very strict. I missed out on meeting a lot of people - like Beyonce. I will never actually forgive her for that one.

"I had school so she never wanted to take me out of school."

Image copyright AFP Image caption Beyonce performed at an AIDS awareness concert organised by Mandela in 2003

As for now, Pumla has a job working for a tech start-up company in Johannesburg.

"There's a responsibility for anyone coming from any family to continue the legacy but I have enough family members already doing that which takes the pressure off me to feel like I have to do something.

"But I am doing something because it's just in my own nature.

"The family name has opened a lot of doors for me but I have to work even harder than normal as I have to prove I didn't get here just because of my surname."

Scientists say global warming could have a catastrophic effect on the planet.

Human activities have increased carbon-dioxide emissions, driving up temperatures. Extreme weather and melting polar ice are among the possible effects.

What is climate change?

The Earth's average temperature is about 15C but has been much higher and lower in the past.

There are natural fluctuations in the climate but scientists say temperatures are now rising faster than at many other times.

This is linked to the greenhouse effect, which describes how the Earth's atmosphere traps some of the Sun's energy.

Solar energy radiating back to space from the Earth's surface is absorbed by greenhouse gases and re-emitted in all directions.

This heats both the lower atmosphere and the surface of the planet. Without this effect, the Earth would be about 30C colder and hostile to life.

Scientists believe we are adding to the natural greenhouse effect, with gases released from industry and agriculture trapping more energy and increasing the temperature.

This is known as climate change or global warming.

What are greenhouse gases?

The greenhouse gas with the greatest impact on warming is water vapour. But it remains in the atmosphere for only a few days.

Carbon dioxide (CO2), however, persists for much longer. It would take hundreds of years for a return to pre-industrial levels and only so much can be soaked up by natural reservoirs such as the oceans.

Most man-made emissions of CO2 come from burning fossil fuels. When carbon-absorbing forests are cut down and left to rot, or burned, that stored carbon is released, contributing to global warming.

Since the industrial revolution began in about 1750, CO2 levels have risen more than 30%. The concentration of CO2 in the atmosphere is higher than at any time in at least 800,000 years.

Other greenhouse gases such as methane and nitrous oxide are also released through human activities but they are less abundant than carbon dioxide.

What is the evidence for warming?

The world is about one degree Celsius warmer than before widespread industrialisation, the World Meteorological Organization (WMO) says.

The 20 warmest years on record all occurred in the past 22 years, with 2015-18 making up the top four.

Across the globe, the average sea level increased by 3.6mm per year between 2005 and 2015.

Most of this change was because water increases in volume as it heats up.

However, melting ice is now thought to be the main reason for rising sea levels. Most glaciers in temperate regions of the world are retreating.

And satellite records show a dramatic decline in Arctic sea-ice since 1979. The Greenland Ice Sheet has experienced record melting in recent years.

Satellite data also shows the West Antarctic Ice Sheet is losing mass. A recent study indicated East Antarctica may also have started to lose mass.

The effects of a changing climate can also be seen in vegetation and land animals. These include earlier flowering and fruiting times for plants and changes in the territories of animals.

How much will temperatures rise in future?

The change in the global surface temperature between 1850 and the end of the 21st Century is likely to exceed 1.5C, most simulations suggest.

The WMO says that if the current warming trend continues, temperatures could rise 3-5C by the end of this century.

Temperature rises of 2C had long been regarded as the gateway to dangerous warming. More recently, scientists and policymakers have argued that limiting temperature rises to 1.5C is safer.

An Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) report in 2018 suggested that keeping to the 1.5C target would require "rapid, far-reaching and unprecedented changes in all aspects of society".

The UN is leading a political effort to stabilise greenhouse-gas emissions. China emits more CO2 than any other country. It is followed by the US and the European Union member states, although emissions per person are much greater there.

But even if we now cut greenhouse-gas emissions dramatically, scientists say the effects will continue. Large bodies of water and ice can take hundreds of years to respond to changes in temperature. And it takes CO2 decades to be removed from the atmosphere.

How will climate change affect us?

There is uncertainty about how great the impact of a changing climate will be.

It could cause freshwater shortages, dramatically alter our ability to produce food, and increase the number of deaths from floods, storms and heatwaves. This is because climate change is expected to increase the frequency of extreme weather events - though linking any single event to global warming is complicated.

As the world warms, more water evaporates, leading to more moisture in the air. This means many areas will experience more intense rainfall - and in some places snowfall. But the risk of drought in inland areas during hot summers will increase. More flooding is expected from storms and rising sea levels. But there are likely to be very strong regional variations in these patterns.

Poorer countries, which are least equipped to deal with rapid change, could suffer the most.

Plant and animal extinctions are predicted as habitats change faster than species can adapt. And the World Health Organization (WHO) has warned that the health of millions could be threatened by increases in malaria, water-borne disease and malnutrition.

As more CO2 is released into the atmosphere, uptake of the gas by the oceans increases, causing the water to become more acidic. This could pose major problems for coral reefs.

Global warming will cause further changes that are likely to create further heating. This includes the release of large quantities of methane as permafrost - frozen soil found mainly at high latitudes - melts.

Responding to climate change will be one of the biggest challenges we face this century.

The Taal volcano in the Philippines continued erupting on Thursday, albeit with less of the ash production seen earlier in the week.

Scientists are monitoring the situation remotely, using ground and space instrumentation, to try to gauge what might happen next.

The radar image on this page is the latest to come down from the Iceye radar constellation.

The Finnish system senses in the microwave portion of the electromagnetic spectrum, which gives it the ability to see through ejected ash and any cloud to detect directly the hard surface below.

The data reveals how the inner lake ("Yellow Lake") that once filled the very heart of the Taal volcano island has now almost completely disappeared.

It was the interaction of this water with magma that drove a lot of the early explosive behaviour.

The dashed line shows the extent of the lake before the onset of Sunday's eruption phase. The solid line traces the waterline at the time of Thursday's image acquisition (06:37 GMT).

The much wider lake body, "Lake Taal", that surrounds the central edifice of the volcano remains in place.

Other radar satellites are looking at how the ground is deforming around the volcano.

The EU's Sentinel-1 spacecraft are able to do this by stacking repeat images one on top of each other.

This interferometric technique will help scientists understand how magma is shifting below the volcano and what that might mean for future activity.

Philippine authorities have been struggling to keep some of the 50,000 residents evacuated from the area from trying to return to their homes to gather possessions and to check on livestock.

"Please allow us to observe the lull period for now. We are studying what that means," Maria Antonia Bornas, a scientist from the Philippines' seismology agency, told reporters.

"A long lull could be just a break from volcanic activity. The danger remains," she was quoted as saying by Agence France-Presse.

Just how much ash has fallen over the surrounding land is evidenced in satellite pictures from the French Spot-7 and Pléiades satellites. The picturesque green landscape has been thoroughly smothered in a blanket of grey.

The left-hand image above was acquired in July last year and shows the original extent of the inner crater lake. The right-hand-image was acquired on Tuesday. Optical satellites cannot see through ash and cloud, in contrast to radar satellites.

Zooming in on these pictures it's possible to see how settlements have become smothered by ash.

   Avoiding meat and dairy products is one of the biggest ways to reduce your environmental impact, according to recent scientific studies.

Switching to a plant-based diet can help fight climate change, according to a major report by the UN's Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), which says the West's high consumption of meat and dairy is fuelling global warming.

But what is the difference between beef and chicken? Does a bowl of rice produce more climate warming greenhouse gases than a plate of chips? Is wine more environmentally friendly than beer?

To find out the climate impact of what you eat and drink, choose from one of the 34 items in our calculator and pick how often you have it.

How do your food choices impact on the environment? Don't cry because you can't play with our interactive. Update your browser to have a go! How do your food choices impact on the environment? Which food would you like? How often do you have it? Find out Your results are below Kilograms of greenhouse gases per serving Choose another item Find out

All figures for each food in the calculator are global averages. If you cannot view the food calculator, click to launch the interactive content.

Design by Prina Shah, development by Felix Stephenson and Becky Rush.

Food production is responsible for a quarter of all greenhouse gas emissions, contributing to global warming, according to a University of Oxford study.

However, the researchers found that the environmental impact of different foods varies hugely.

Their findings showed that meat and other animal products are responsible for more than half of food-related greenhouse gas emissions, despite providing only a fifth of the calories we eat and drink.

Of all the products analysed in the study, beef and lamb were found to have by far the most damaging effect on the environment.

The findings echo recommendations on how individuals can lessen climate change by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC).

When it comes to our diets, the IPCC says we need to buy less meat, milk, cheese and butter - but also eat more locally sourced seasonal food, and throw less of it away.

The IPCC also recommends that we insulate homes, take trains and buses instead of planes, and use video conferencing instead of business travel.

Cutting meat and dairy products from your diet could reduce an individual's carbon footprint from food by two-thirds, according to the Oxford study, published in the journal Science.

"What we eat is one of the most powerful drivers behind most of the world's major environmental issues, whether it's climate change or biodiversity loss," study researcher Joseph Poore told BBC News.

Changing your diet can make a big difference to your personal environmental footprint, from saving water to reducing pollution and the loss of forests, he said.

"It reduces the amount of land required to produce your food by about 75% - that's a huge reduction, particularly if you scale that up globally," Poore explained.

If you fly regularly, replacing flying with other forms of transport may have a bigger impact on your carbon footprint than changing your diet. A passenger's carbon footprint from a one-way flight from London to New York is just under half a tonne of greenhouse gases. Switching from a regular petrol vehicle to an electric car could save more than double that over a year.

Knowing how and where your food is produced is also important, as the same food can have huge differences in environmental impact.

For example, beef cattle raised on deforested land is responsible for 12 times more greenhouse gas emissions than cows reared on natural pastures.

The average beef from South America results in three times the amount of greenhouse gases as beef produced in Europe - and uses 10 times as much land.

Meat and dairy are not the only foods where the choices you make can make a big difference.

Chocolate and coffee originating from deforested rainforest produce relatively high greenhouse gases.

For climate-friendly tomatoes, choose those grown outdoors or in high-tech greenhouses, instead of in greenhouses heated by gas or oil. Environmentally-minded beer-drinkers may be interested to know that draught beer is responsible for fewer emissions than recyclable cans, or worse, glass bottles.

Even the most climate-friendly meat options still produce more greenhouse gases than vegetarian protein sources, like beans or nuts.

How did we make the calculator?

How is the environmental impact calculated?

University of Oxford researcher Joseph Poore, and Thomas Nemecek of the Agroecology and Environment Research Division in Zurich, Switzerland, looked at the environmental impact of 40 major food products that represent the vast majority of what is eaten globally.

They assessed the effect of these foods on climate-warming greenhouse gas emissions and the amount of land and fresh water used across all stages of their production, including processing, packaging, and transportation, but excluding the cooking process.

By analysing data from nearly 40,000 farms, 1,600 processors, packaging types and retailers, Poore and Nemecek were able to assess how different production practices and geographies have very different consequences on the planet.

What about serving sizes?

The data in the study looked at the environmental impact for 1kg of each of the different food products.

For this story, these were converted to impact per serving sizes based on serving sizes from the British Dietetic Association (BDA) and healthy diet portion sizes from BUPA.

The figures for serving sizes based on the BDA and BUPA suggestions are often lower than portion sizes commonly found in restaurants and what people normally expect, so the figures returned by the calculator on the impact of individuals' consumption are likely to be higher in reality.

Protein-rich foods were calculated using the impact per 100g of protein from Poore and Nemecek's research and data on protein per serving from the BDA, to avoid differences between cooked and uncooked foods.

What are greenhouse gases?

The figures for greenhouse gas emissions are in kilograms of carbon dioxide equivalents (CO2eq). This is a unit that converts the impact of different kinds of greenhouse gases, like methane and nitrous oxide, to the equivalent amount of carbon dioxide.

How do you know what my diet is equal to in miles driven?

The annual impact from eating a specific food is calculated by multiplying the impact of one serving of that food by the times it is eaten in a year, based on the weekly estimates submitted by the user.

These are then compared with the emissions of other daily habits. The European Environment Agency estimates that driving a regular petrol car produces 392g of CO2eq/mile over its entire lifecycle, including emissions from the vehicle's production, fuel production and exhaust emissions per mile.

Heating the average UK home produces 2.34 tonnes of CO2eq annually, according to data from the Committee on Climate Change, and a passenger's carbon footprint for a return flight from London to Malaga is 320kg CO2eq, based on figures from the Carbon Neutral calculator.

The land used to produce the annual consumption of each food is compared with the size of a double tennis court, 261 metres squared.

The annual amount of water used is compared with a shower, based on figures suggesting the average shower lasts eight minutes and uses up 65 litres. Only "blue water", i.e. water taken out of rivers or the ground, is included in the data.

Should aviation be taxed more? Should SUVs be banned? Should wind power be subsidised by taxpayers?

These are the sort of the climate-related questions to be pondered by a new "citizens' assembly", composed of 110 members of the public.

The panel has been selected to reflect key sectors of society and a range of opinion.

They will spend four weekends listening to evidence from experts on how climate policy and science will affect the UK.

Then they’ll offer their opinions on the best ways for Britain to achieve its demanding law that mandates "net zero" carbon emissions by 2050.

Net zero describes achieving an overall balance between the emissions produced and emissions removed from the atmosphere.

What's the reasoning behind it?

The idea for this unprecedented assembly was conceived by MPs on six parliamentary select committees who want to learn more about the public's opinions on climate change.

It will solely offer advice for the UK to meet its own Climate Change Act.

It will not debate the scientific consensus that climate change is dangerous.

Nor will it debate if the net zero target should be brought forward to 2030, as the Extinction Rebellion group has called for.

What will the jury members do?

Some 30,000 invitations to take part were sent out under a process designed to represent all parts of the UK and differences in race, gender, age and views on climate change. People from both rural and urban areas were selected.

Thousands agreed to take part, then these were whittled down to 110.

The gathering will include views of all hues – from people who don’t fear climate change to those who definitely do.

Image copyright Reuters Image caption The process will sound out how willing people are to change their lifestyles, including how they get around (SUV pictured)

Most of the presentations they experience will come from academics, although think-tanks, NGOs, and industry voices will also be heard.

On food, for instance, the assembly will hear opposing views from the National Farmers Union and from the Royal Society of Arts and Commerce, which argues for the need to change the way we farm.

The project’s being organised by a charity, Involve. It pledges to “uphold key principles of balance, accuracy and comprehensiveness”.

What will be the outcome?

The assembly’s website says the members of its advisory panel were chosen to represent a broad range of views across different sectors. All the expert advisers are acting voluntarily.

Sarah Allan from Involve told BBC News: "The aim is to give people a say on how the UK tackles climate change, and to give parliament and the government an understanding of what people think and where priorities lie.

“The focus is on how the UK achieves net zero. We will get people to look at trade-offs. They can’t say: 'we want net zero' then vote for doing nothing about it.'

She continued: “The Irish assembly was an incredibly useful tool for decision-makers – we are very optimistic that the UK climate change assembly will be useful too.”

One of the project’s leaders is Lorraine Whitmarsh, professor of environmental psychology at Cardiff University.

“It’s very exciting - we haven’t done anything on this level before,” she told BBC News. “It’s huge, and the recruitment (of members) has to be gold standard."

Will climate sceptics be involved?

Ms Whitmarsh explained: “There will be sceptics who don’t even believe climate change is caused by humans. But even they may want to consider evidence that some climate polices (such as active transport) will have health benefits attached.

“There will be other people who are very worried about climate change – but they may turn out to be unwilling to take on some of the financial consequences involved.

“It’s going to be really interesting.”

The announcement by the six select committees to hold a citizens assembly on climate change was in direct response to government policy on net zero carbon emissions by 2050, and was announced on 20 June 2019.

The net zero policy became law on 27 June 2019, making the UK the first major economy in the world to legislate for net zero. The 2019 Conservative party manifesto re-affirmed the government’s commitment to this target.

   Sir David Attenborough warns of climate 'crisis moment'

"The moment of crisis has come" in efforts to tackle climate change, Sir David Attenborough has warned.

According to the renowned naturalist and broadcaster, "we have been putting things off for year after year".

"As I speak, south east Australia is on fire. Why? Because the temperatures of the Earth are increasing," he said.

Sir David's comments came in a BBC News interview to launch a year of special coverage on the subject of climate change.

Scientists say climate change is one of several factors behind the Australian fires; others include how forests are managed and natural patterns in the weather.

Sir David told me it was "palpable nonsense" for some politicians and commentators to suggest that the Australian fires were nothing to do with the world becoming warmer.

"We know perfectly well," he said, that human activity is behind the heating of the planet.

What does Sir David mean by 'the moment of crisis'?

He's highlighting the fact that while climate scientists are becoming clearer about the need for a rapid response, the pace of international negotiations is grindingly slow.

The most recent talks - in Madrid last month - were branded a disappointment by the UN Secretary-General, the British government and others.

Decisions on key issues were put off and several countries including Australia and Brazil were accused of trying to dodge their commitments.

"We have to realise that this is not playing games," Sir David said.

"This is not just having a nice little debate, arguments and then coming away with a compromise.

"This is an urgent problem that has to be solved and, what's more, we know how to do it - that's the paradoxical thing, that we're refusing to take steps that we know have to be taken."

What are those steps?

Back in 2018, the UN climate science panel spelled out how the world could have a reasonable chance of avoiding the most dangerous temperature rises in future.

It said that emissions of the gases heating the planet - from power stations and factories, vehicles and agriculture - should be almost halved by 2030.

Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Australia has been badly hit by bushfires

Instead the opposite is happening.

The release of those gases is still increasing rather than falling and the key gas, carbon dioxide, is now in the atmosphere at a level far above anything experienced in human history.

As Sir David put it: "Every year that passes makes those steps more and more difficult to achieve."

Why does this matter right now?

This year is seen as a vital opportunity to turn the tide on climate change.

The UK is hosting what's billed as a crucial UN summit, known as COP26, in Glasgow in November.

Ahead of that gathering, governments worldwide are coming under pressure to toughen their targets for cutting emissions.

That's because their current pledges do not go nearly far enough.

Assuming they are delivered as promised (and there's no guarantee of that), there could still be a rise in the global average temperature of more than 3C by the end of the century, compared to pre-industrial levels.

The latest assessment by the UN's Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) lays bare the dangers of that.

It suggests that a rise of anything above 1.5C would mean that coastal flooding, heatwaves and damage to coral reefs would become more severe.

And the latest figures show that the world has already warmed by just over 1C.

What happens next?

As things stand, further heating looks inevitable.

"We're already living in a changed world," according to Professor Ed Hawkins of the University of Reading, a scientist whose depictions of global warming have often gone viral on social media.

He uses bold coloured stripes to show how much each year's temperature is above or below average - different shades of red for warmer and blue for colder.

Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Our Planet Matters: Climate change explained

The designs now adorn T-shirts, scarves and even a tram in Germany.

At the moment, Prof Hawkins uses dark red to denote the highest level of warming, but regions such as the Arctic Ocean have seen that maximum level year after year.

Such is the scale of change that he's having to search for new colours.

"I'm thinking about adding dark purple or even black", he told me, to convey future increases in temperature.

"People might think climate change is a distant prospect but we're seeing so many examples around the world, like in Australia, of new records and new extremes."

What else is on the environmental agenda this year?

The natural world, and whether we can stop harming it.

While most political attention will be on climate change, 2020 is also seen as potentially important for halting the damage human activity is having on ecosystems.

Sir David has a blunt explanation for why this matters: "We actually depend upon the natural world for every breath of air we take and every mouthful of food that we eat."

World leaders are being invited to the Chinese city of Kunming for a major conference on how to safeguard Nature.

Image copyright Getty Images Image caption The northern white rhino (seen here) is down to just two animals, making it "functionally" extinct

A landmark report last year warned that as many as one million species of animals, insects and plants are threatened with extinction in the coming decades.

A more recent study found that the growth of cities, the clearing of forests for farming and the soaring demand for fish had significantly altered nearly three-quarters of the land and more than two-thirds of the oceans.

One of the scientists involved, Prof Andy Purvis of the Natural History Museum in London, says that by undermining important habitats, "we're hacking away at our safety net, we're trashing environments we depend on".

He points to the impact of everything from the use of palm oil in processed food and shampoo to the pressures created by fast fashion.

And while the need for conservation is understood in many developed countries, Prof Purvis says "we've exported the damage to countries too poor to handle the environmental cost of what they're selling to us".

The gathering in Kunming takes place in October, a month before the UN climate summit in Glasgow, confirming this year as crucial for our relations with the planet.

"The moment of crisis has come" in efforts to tackle climate change, Sir David Attenborough has warned.

He spoke as BBC News launched a year of special coverage on global warming.

Here are our answers to a range of readers' questions.

What are the most important things people can do? - Maureen Watt, Livingston, Scotland

Climate change will need to be tackled by governments worldwide, through measures like the 2005 Kyoto Protocol. This brought nations together for the first time in a single agreement on tackling climate change.

But everyone has a carbon footprint. This is the amount of greenhouse gases like carbon dioxide - which contributes to global warming - released into the atmosphere by people's actions.

This can be reduced in a number of ways. According to a recent report by a group of international scientists, transport is responsible for 34% of a household's carbon footprint in high-income countries like the UK. The report calls for a major programme of investment in the rail and bus network, with lower ticket prices and investment in safer cycling.

Home heating presents another challenge and opportunity. It is responsible for 21% of a household's carbon footprint.

This could be cut by turning down the thermostat, having better-insulated houses and changing to low-carbon heating systems.

Is the fundamental problem human overpopulation? - David Bassett, Locks Heath, Hants

According to the United Nations, the current world population is about 7.7 billion and could reach 9.7 billion in 2050.

This population growth drives higher demand for food, greater energy consumption and more competition for resources. And it increases the production of the gases that cause global warming.

And a recent major study, by a global group of 11,000 scientists, concluded that the world needs to stabilise its population.

The study has attracted quite a deal of controversy, but its authors say such action is needed if the world is to avoid what they call "a catastrophic threat" from climate change.

Is a plant-based diet one of the best steps you can take? - Sophie Hill, Astwood Bank, Worcs

It is estimated that 26% of global emissions come from food and more than half of this from animal products.

This is because producing food from animals uses more resources than food from plants. Cows and sheep also produce methane - a greenhouse gas.

According to a 2019 report by UN experts, switching to a plant-based diet can help fight climate change.

They said that more people could be fed using less land if individuals cut down on eating meat. But they stopped short of advising people to become vegan or vegetarian.

And a University of Oxford study found that if everybody on Earth cut meat and dairy from their diet, there could be a 49% reduction in greenhouse gas emissions from food production.

What can we do about other, bigger countries not adopting green practices? - Christina Dudley, Beenham, Berks

China and the US are the world's largest emitters of CO2, responsible for 16 megatonnes between them a year.

In terms of emissions per head of population, the picture is different. The US is still near the top, with 15.53 tonnes. But the UK (5.99 tonnes) is only slightly behind China (6.59 tonnes).

So what can a smaller country, like the UK, do to exert pressure for change?

On an individual level, consumers could decide to seek out "green" products and boycott ones from more polluting parts of the world, says Alyssa Gilbert, climate policy director at Imperial College London.

There is also an opportunity for the UK to come up with innovative ideas that larger countries might adopt, Ms Gilbert suggests.

"As a country we are small and nimble, so we can pilot ideas around technology and policy in the hope that we can export them to other countries", she says.

At government level, the UK can also use diplomacy, as well as international aid, to bring about change.

Why are we not capturing and using the greenhouse gases already in our atmosphere? - Jonathan Miller, Cornwall

Carbon capture, to remove and store greenhouse gases, already happens naturally. All plants and trees take carbon dioxide from the atmosphere and groundwater.

So, planting trees is seen as an important weapon in the fight against global warming.

The UK's Committee on Climate Change (CCC) says significant rises in tree planting "need to happen quickly" if other targets to cut carbon are not met.

It says 30,000 hectares of woodland should be planted annually, more than double the new trees planted in 2018.

The UK government says it is committed to planting 11 million trees by 2022.

In February 2019, the Drax power station in North Yorkshire, became the first in Europe to capture carbon dioxide (CO2) from wood-burning.

Another approach, currently being offered by a company in Switzerland, is to pull carbon dioxide directly from the air. This gas can then be sold for other purposes, like being used to grow vegetables in hi-tech greenhouses.

But schemes like these are, as yet, relatively few and small-scale.

Was it the asteroid or colossal volcanism that initiated the demise of the dinosaurs 66 million years ago?

This has been a bit of a "to and fro" argument of late, but now a group of scientists has weighed in with what they claim is the definitive answer.

"It was the asteroid 'wot dun it'!" Prof Paul Wilson told the BBC.

His team's analysis of ocean sediments shows that huge volcanoes that erupted in India did not change the climate enough to drive the extinction.

Volcanoes can spew enormous volumes of gases into the atmosphere that can both cool and warm the planet.

And the Deccan Traps, as the volcanic terrain in India is known, certainly had massive scale - hundreds of thousands of cubic km of molten rock were erupted onto the land surface over thousands of years.

But the new research from Southampton University's Prof Wilson, and colleagues from elsewhere in Europe and the US, indicates there is a mismatch in both the effect and timing of the volcanism's influence.

The group drilled into the North Atlantic seafloor to retrieve its ancient muds.

"The deep ocean sediments are packed full of these microscopic marine organisms called Foraminifera," Prof Wilson explained.

"You get about a thousand of them in a teaspoon of sediment. And we can use their shells to figure out the chemistry of the ocean and its temperature, so we can study in great detail the environmental changes that are occurring in the run-up to the extinction event.

"And what we discovered is that the only way in which we can get our (climate) model simulations to match the observed temperature changes is to have the volcanic emissions of harmful gases done and dusted a couple of hundred thousand years before the impact event.

"We find the impact event is exactly contemporaneous with the extinction."

Investigations of a 200km-wide crater under the Gulf of Mexico suggest it is the scar left by the culprit asteroid.

When it hit the Earth, the city-sized object would immediately have generated tsunami and wide-scale fires - in addition to hurling billions of tonnes of debris in all directions.

But what scientists have also established recently is that the asteroid struck rocks rich in sulphur. When this material was vaporised and ejected into the high atmosphere, it would have led to a rapid and deep cooling of the climate (albeit over a relatively short period), making life a struggle for all sorts of plant and animal life.

As the fossil record shows, the dinosaurs, apart from birds, couldn't get beyond the stressful environmental changes. In contrast, the mammals could and rose to the prominence they enjoy today.

The new study is published in the journal Science. Its lead author is Dr Pincelli Hull from Yale University.

For more than two decades after his asylum application was rejected, Sunny found a safe haven aboard the buses that zigzag across London at night. What's it like to spend every night on the lower decks?

Sunny waits patiently, wind penetrating his well-worn jacket and the winter cold biting at his extremities.

It's past midnight and his legs are weary but he stands firm and smiles as the bus lunges to a halt, its wing mirror clipping overgrown branches on its way. He moves aside to let other passengers board, greets the familiar face of the driver with a gentle bow of the head and taps his weathered Oyster card on the payment point.

Relieved at finding his favoured spot at the back of the lower deck empty, he slides into place and gets comfortable for the long ride ahead. Sunny hugs his bag to his stomach, feels his wrinkled hands start to thaw, and closes his eyes.

Image copyright Venetia Menzies Image caption Sunny's travel card holder quotes Jesus: "Peace I bequeath to you, My own peace I give you, A peace the world cannot give."

Leaving behind the smell of fried chicken and noise of London's late-night traffic, his mind drifts.

He sees his younger self, kneeling in prayer between the concrete walls of a Nigerian prison, waiting to be executed. His offence: struggling for democracy.

A guard barges into the cell, lifts him to his feet and rushes him down silent corridors, out into blinding sunlight, where a car is waiting.

Family and friends have bought his freedom, paying off everyone from the prison officials to the air hostess on the flight to London.

Sunny is jerked back to the present as a scrum of drunken men, singing tunelessly, trail through the doors and up to the top deck. It must be three or four in the morning, he calculates - the usual hour for trouble.

Around this time, Sunny often notices three distinct groups around him. It's a neat survey of modern London. There are those who came to this country for a better life, rushing to their pre-dawn cleaning jobs. Another group - mostly indigenous Britons - heads home from the nightclubs, talking loudly and cramming down fast food. And finally there are the homeless, those who have nowhere else to go, for whom buses are a place to rest.

Sunny doesn't resent the others; he has learned to enjoy their boisterousness. When they smile, he smiles. When they laugh, he laughs too. It's amazing how a few pints can evaporate class boundaries, stripping reserved Englishmen of their inhibitions so they chat with the homeless as temporary equals.

Sunny tries to recall the last time he felt as happy as these drunken men.

Image copyright Venetia Menzies Image caption Sunny is telling his story as part of a documentary photography project

Perhaps it was when his asylum claim was still under review. Back then he was full of gratitude for his second chance at life. He took a course in documentary-making, choosing to report on the lives of London's homeless, never imagining he would soon be in their shoes.

Sunny had dared to hope for a bright future, safe under the protection of Her Majesty the Queen - that figurehead familiar from sun-faded colonial posters across Nigeria. But his request for asylum was refused.

That left him with two options: go home to a country under the iron fist of a military ruler, where his death sentence would finally be carried out, or go underground.

It wasn't a difficult choice.

And so began 21 years as a nomad on London's buses, which Sunny quickly realised were safer and warmer than the streets.

It was a church minister, a woman of unwavering generosity, who first bought him a monthly pass to save him multiple nightly fares. She continued to do so, month after month, and other friends would chip in if she wasn't around.

By day Sunny would volunteer at churches - he would attend several during his time in London. When his work was done, he would often head to Westminster Reference Library where he could catch up on the day's news or pick up where he'd left off in the book he'd been reading.

He might then ask a restaurant manager if they could spare some food, and says he was rarely turned away.

Image copyright Sunny Image caption Sunny's photographs provide a homeless person's perspective on the world

But no later than 9pm he would invariably be stepping aboard a bus for the first of three, maybe four, nightly trips across the capital.

He soon discovered the best buses for a good rest. There was the trusty N29, from Trafalgar Square to the northern suburb of Wood Green. But the 25 - which ran 24 hours - offered the longest uninterrupted sleep. In traffic, it would take two hours to get from central London to Ilford, in Essex, where - if he was really lucky - a driver might take pity and leave him sleeping on board at the terminus.

More often, the homeless passengers - maybe four or five of them - would be woken and turfed off until the next driver arrived.

Most were destitute women, British or African, who used the bus as a sanctuary from the threat of sexual assault. Laden with bags, they would be grateful for Sunny's help lugging them on and off the bus.

Sunny always travelled light. A small tote bag allowed him to avoid the stigma of homelessness during daylight hours.

Some homeless folk would stretch out across seats but he preferred not to inconvenience other riders.

It took a while to learn all the tricks. At first he hadn't worried about where to sit. But then he found himself in a confrontation with two men who had been trying to set light to the hair of an unsuspecting woman in front. He chased them off but resolved to avoid conflict where possible.

The lower deck, he concluded, was the preserve of reasonable people, of families and the elderly. Trouble rarely erupted so close to the driver. The back seats were optimal, not just for the head rest but for peace of mind.

But there were always distractions: the lurching bus, the neon lights, the noisy night-riders and the humming engine. Two hours of proper sleep across an entire night was an achievement.

At dawn - or when he got hungry, whichever came first - he would head to a McDonald's.

He never begged but friendly staff at the Leicester Square branch would give him food and let him shave in the bathrooms. Fellow customers could be kind, too.

Or, if he timed it right, he could hop off at the 24-hour branch in Haringey - halfway along the N29 route. There, he could enjoy a peace that was rare in the central London branches, rest his head on a table and continue his slumber.

For a handful of Christmases, Sunny broke his routine and tried winter night shelters provided by churches.

Seven different churches worked a rota. But they were scattered in different locations across the capital, creating a daily exodus of people - the "walking dead", in his words - trying to reach their next bed before the evening curfew.

Sunny came to realise he preferred the bus to lying on stone floors, packed shoulder-to-shoulder. It was hard to sleep through the smell of tobacco, alcohol and unwashed bodies. And, of course, the screams of the others as they lay there tormented by nightmares.

From the seats of London buses, Sunny watched the changing face of the capital. Slowly, the white population declined as a proportion of the total. The ranks of the homeless expanded.

In this most diverse of spaces, he became adept at matching faces or dialects to places of origin. And he developed a sixth sense for trouble, detecting warning signs in gestures: the smirk of trouble-making teens, the pursed lips of an explosive racist.

There were combinations that could result in confrontation: drunken football fans and a veiled woman; tired commuters and people using speakerphone; gang members and their local rivals. In the months following the Brexit referendum of 2016, hostility to migrants seemed to become more commonplace. "Go back home," became a regular refrain.

Sunny didn't blame the British government for his predicament. Had his own country's not been so bad, he wouldn't have been here in the first place.

Eventually, the refugee centre at Notre Dame de France church, off Leicester Square, made an application for leave to remain on his behalf. If people prove they have continuously lived in the UK for 20 years, they can qualify to settle. But Sunny had spent that time avoiding all records, evading detection. How could he demonstrate he had been there all this time?

"I understand that your client is currently homeless, but we still require documentary evidence to show continuous residence from 1995 to the present date," said a letter from the Home Office. "Evidence such as utility bills, bank statements, tenancy agreements…"

Sunny asked the friendliest bus drivers to write him a letter of support. One obliged, confirming he was "a regular rider throughout the night".

The churches he had volunteered at over the years provided supporting statements and dug out old photographs recording his presence at charity events.

These days Sunny is the one taking pictures. He reaches inside his bag for the disposable camera he's been given to tell his story as part of a photography project.

There are a few frames left. Lifting the viewfinder to his eye, Sunny pushes firm against the flash button and pauses to adjust his composition. Click… He releases the shutter.

The photograph will not simply show rows of mostly empty seats on the lower deck of a bus. It will be a picture of life as a free man.

Image copyright Sunny

At the age of 55, in 2017, Sunny was granted leave to remain. It had taken a year but finally he had the right to shelter, to work, to exist. And he was thankful.

It is almost his stop, deep in south London's suburbs - he still isn't used to travelling to a destination. Even now he sometimes sleeps on buses, though more often during the day rather than at night. For so long a sanctuary, they remain a place to empty his mind - their familiarity a comfort.

Sunny's knees click as he hoists himself up. He's getting older, his struggle has aged him beyond his years. He thanks the driver and carefully steps down to the pavement. Leaning into the breeze, he walks towards his bedsit, smiling as the cold cracks his lips.

Sunny, whose name has been changed, collaborated with photographer and journalist Venetia Menzies to document his story for one year. This story is drawn from interviews with Sunny, his own photographs and portraits that preserve his anonymity.

   Confessions of a slaughterhouse worker

   About 100 million animals are killed for meat in the UK every month - but very little is heard about the people doing the killing. Here, one former abattoir worker describes her job, and the effect it had on her mental health.

Warning: Some readers may find this story disturbing

When I was a child I dreamed of becoming a vet. I imagined myself playing with mischievous puppies, calming down frightened kittens, and - as I was a countryside kid - performing check-ups on the local farm animals if they felt under the weather.

It was a pretty idyllic life that I dreamt up for myself - but it's not quite how things worked out. Instead, I ended up working in a slaughterhouse.

I was there for six years and, far from spending my days making poorly cows feel better, I was in charge of ensuring about 250 of them were killed every day.

Whether they eat meat or not, most people in the UK have never been inside an abattoir - and for good reason. They are filthy, dirty places. There's animal faeces on the floor, you see and smell the guts, and the walls are covered in blood.

And the smell... It hits you like a wall when you first enter, and then hangs thick in the air around you. The odour of dying animals surrounds you like a vapour.

Why would anybody choose to visit, let alone work in a place like this?

For me, it was because I'd already spent a couple of decades working in the food industry - in ready-meal factories and the like. So when I got an offer from an abattoir to be a quality control manager, working directly with the slaughtermen, it felt like a fairly innocuous job move. I was in my 40s at the time.

On my first day, they gave me a tour of the premises, explained how everything worked and, most importantly, asked me pointedly and repeatedly if I was OK. It was quite common for people to faint during the tour, they explained, and the physical safety of visitors and new starters was very important to them. I was OK, I think. I felt sick, but I thought I'd get used to it.

Soon, though, I realised there was no point pretending that it was just another job. I'm sure not all abattoirs are the same but mine was a brutal, dangerous place to work. There were countless occasions when, despite following all of the procedures for stunning, slaughterers would get kicked by a massive, spasming cow as they hoisted it up to the machine for slaughter. Similarly, cows being brought in would get scared and panic, which was pretty terrifying for all of us too. You'll know if you've ever stood next to one that they are huge animals.

Personally, I didn't suffer physical injuries, but the place affected my mind.

As I spent day after day in that large, windowless box, my chest felt increasingly heavy and a grey fog descended over me. At night, my mind would taunt me with nightmares, replaying some of the horrors I'd witnessed throughout the day.

One skill that you master while working at an abattoir is disassociation. You learn to become numb to death and to suffering. Instead of thinking about cows as entire beings, you separate them into their saleable, edible body parts. It doesn't just make the job easier - it's necessary for survival.

There are things, though, that have the power to shatter the numbness. For me, it was the heads.

At the end of the slaughter line there was a huge skip, and it was filled with hundreds of cows' heads. Each one of them had been flayed, with all of the saleable flesh removed. But one thing was still attached - their eyeballs.

Whenever I walked past that skip, I couldn't help but feel like I had hundreds of pairs of eyes watching me. Some of them were accusing, knowing that I'd participated in their deaths. Others seemed to be pleading, as if there were some way I could go back in time and save them. It was disgusting, terrifying and heart-breaking, all at the same time. It made me feel guilty. The first time I saw those heads, it took all of my strength not to vomit.

I know things like this bothered the other workers, too. I'll never forget the day, after I'd been at the abattoir for a few months, when one of the lads cut into a freshly killed cow to gut her - and out fell the foetus of a calf. She was pregnant. He immediately started shouting and throwing his arms about.

I took him into a meeting room to calm him down - and all he could say was, "It's just not right, it's not right," over and over again. These were hard men, and they rarely showed any emotion. But I could see tears prickling his eyes.

Even worse than pregnant cows, though, were the young calves we sometimes had to kill.

A physically demanding role

On its website, the British Meat Processors Association (BMPA) says the UK meat industry has some of the highest standards of hygiene and welfare in the world.

Many of its members, it says, "are at the forefront of abattoir design with facilities designed to house the animals and help them move around the site with ease and without any pain, distress or suffering".

Meat processing in the UK employs about 75,000 people of whom approximately 69% are from other European Union member states, the BMPA notes.

"The barrier to British people taking up roles in meat processing is an unwillingness to work in what is perceived to be a challenging environment," it says. "Most people, while they eat meat, find it difficult to work in its production partly because of the obvious aversion to the slaughter process but also because it is a physically demanding role."

At the height of the BSE and bovine tuberculosis crises in the 1990s, whole herds of animals had to be slaughtered. I worked at the slaughterhouse after 2010, so well after the BSE crisis, but if an animal tested positive for TB or BSE they would still bring the entire herd in to be culled - bulls, heifers and calves. I remember one day in particular, when I'd been there for about a year or so, when we had to slaughter five calves at the same time.

We tried to keep them within the rails of the pens, but they were so small and bony that they could easily skip out and trot around, slightly wobbly on their newly born legs. They sniffed us, like puppies, because they were young and curious. Some of the boys and I stroked them, and they suckled our fingers.

When the time came to kill them, it was tough, both emotionally and physically. Slaughterhouses are designed for slaughtering really large animals, so the stun boxes are normally just about the right size to hold a cow that weighs about a tonne. When we put the first calf in, it only came about a quarter of a way up the box, if that. We put all five calves in at once. Then we killed them.

Afterwards, looking at the dead animals on the ground, the slaughterers were visibly upset.

I rarely saw them so vulnerable. Emotions in the abattoir tended to be bottled up. Nobody talked about their feelings; there was an overwhelming sense that you weren't allowed to show weakness. Plus, there were a lot of workers who wouldn't have been able to talk about their feelings to the rest of us even if they'd wanted to. Many were migrant workers, predominantly from Eastern Europe, whose English wasn't good enough for them to seek help if they were struggling.

A lot of the men I was working with were also moonlighting elsewhere - they'd finish their 10 or 11 hours at the abattoir before going on to another job - and exhaustion often took its toll. Some developed alcohol problems, often coming into work smelling strongly of drink. Others became addicted to energy drinks, and more than one had a heart attack. These drinks were then removed from the abattoir vending machines, but people would still bring them in from home and drink them secretly in their cars.

'I'm an animal lover'

A slaughterman at Tideford abbattoir, described his approach to his work, for The Food Chain on the BBC World Service:

"Basically, I'm an animal lover. I don't take any pleasure in what we're doing, but if I can do it as quietly and professionally as possible, then I think we've achieved something. Just be professional, do it, then switch off - and then, when we've finished work, go home and be a normal person. It's not for everybody. I know a couple of butchers that would not walk inside this abattoir; the thought of taking something's life, they find that difficult to accept, or witness."

Listen to The Food Chain: Inside the Abbattoir

Abattoir work has been linked to multiple mental health problems - one researcher uses the term "Perpetrator-Induced Traumatic Syndrome" to refer to symptoms of PTSD suffered by slaughterhouse workers. I personally suffered from depression, a condition exacerbated by the long hours, the relentless work, and being surrounded by death. After a while, I started feeling suicidal.

It's unclear whether slaughterhouse work causes these problems, or whether the job attracts people with pre-existing conditions. But either way, it's an incredibly isolating job, and it's hard to seek help. When I'd tell people what I did for work, I'd either be met with absolute revulsion, or a curious, jokey fascination. Either way, I could never open up to people about the effect it was having on me. Instead I sometimes joked along with them, telling gory tales about skinning a cow or handling its innards. But mostly I just kept quiet.

A few years into my time at the abattoir, a colleague started making flippant comments about "not being here in six months". Everyone would laugh it off. He was a bit of a joker, so people assumed he was taking the mick, saying he'd have a new job or something. But it made me feel really uneasy. I took him into a side room and asked him what he meant, and he broke down. He admitted that he was plagued by suicidal thoughts, that he didn't feel like he could cope any more, and that he needed help - but he begged me not to tell our bosses.

I was able to help him get treatment from his GP - and in helping him, I realised I needed to help myself too. I felt like the horrific things I was seeing had clouded my thinking, and I was in a full-blown state of depression. It felt like a big step, but I needed to get out of there.

After I left my job at the abattoir, things started looking brighter. I changed tack completely and began working with mental health charities, encouraging people to open up about their feelings and seek professional help - even if they don't think they need it, or feel like they don't deserve it.

A few months after leaving, I heard from one of my former colleagues. He told me that a man who'd worked with us, whose job was to flay the carcasses, had killed himself.

Sometimes I recall my days at the slaughterhouse. I think about my former colleagues working relentlessly, as though they were treading water in a vast ocean, with dry land completely out of sight. I remember my colleagues who didn't survive.

And at night, when I close my eyes and try to sleep, I still sometimes see hundreds of pairs of eyeballs staring back at me.

Two months ago, as flood water descended on the village of Fishlake, near Doncaster, Peter Trimingham battled through the night to help neighbours to safety. The experience has left him thinking hard about what can be done to prevent this happening again, reports the BBC's Sue Mitchell.

When Peter Trimingham volunteered to become a flood warden in the village where he's lived since childhood, he hadn't imagined it would lead to the toughest challenge of his life.

He and his four fellow flood wardens, all over 60, started hastily bagging sand on the night of 8 November, but quickly ran out. The village was cut off by water, so it took hours for fresh supplies to get through.

The scale of the disaster took everyone by surprise, because the village hadn't flooded since 1947. The memory of past floods had faded as new generations had moved in. Only grainy photographs remained.

"There's a gorgeous photograph in the village of past flooding. The flood water used to shoot down the main street, and the locals had it cracked. They've got barrels of beer positioned carefully from the step to the pub and raised up by about five feet and they've got barrels in the road and planks that run from the door of the pub across to the higher ground at the other side of the road. They'd be walking across it to get their beer. And that's in 1923," says Peter.

According to Prof Ian Rotherham, an ecologist and environmental historian from Sheffield Hallam University, Fishlake was caught in a pincer movement between two rivers, the Don and Ea Beck. Both burst their banks into an area of drained fenland that was already sodden from rain over a period of weeks.

"I've been studying the history of the area and was talking to community groups down the river Don and various people were saying, 'Well my grandad used to have a boat and we didn't know why,'" he says.

"All the way from Sheffield right down to Doncaster, the communities had boats because they knew they got flooded five, six times a year, and you just had the boat. Like the guys with the barrels of beer, you were prepared. But then from the 1950s, we've engineered the solutions and people then forget that they ever needed that, and [now they say], 'Oh yeah, we thought my grandad was bonkers, but aha, that explains it!"

Peter Trimingham and the other flood wardens accept that a degree of complacency had crept in but believe that some of the problems in Fishlake have their roots in flood defence systems introduced a decade ago in Sheffield. In 2007, floods in the city led to two deaths and hundreds of evacuations. After that, £20m was spent on a flood-defence scheme in the Don Valley near the city, which Ian Rotherham agrees contributed to Fishlake's problems.

"In Sheffield, the main factories and other areas affected in 2007 are now protected. However, if you are keeping the water out there, then you are moving it faster downstream, and Fishlake bore the brunt of this. You're not holding the water in the upper catchment - defending those businesses and premises means you're moving the water downstream faster. It's going to hit sooner, harder and deeper."

Peter and the other flood wardens were powerless when this water poured in, flooding more than half of the 250 homes in the village.

People were working in the dark with freezing cold water pouring through every crack and hole and rising quickly.

"It's pretty traumatic. You've not got vision; you've got darkness and floodwater - two very, very dangerous combinations," Peter says.

"You have no concept of time. You can't see and my phone was destroyed in the flood water anyway. You feel so small and insignificant and useless: something much more powerful than you can't be imagined unless you've been in it."

For many in Fishlake the loss can't be quantified: it includes everything from photos, treasured possessions and mementos to cars and furniture.

The community came together in the immediate aftermath of the disaster. Farmers used their tractors to help get people to safety. One, Greg Mawson, describes how he battled to save others, only to return to find his farmyard under up to eight feet of water and thousands of tonnes of straw lost.

The local church, St Cuthbert's, provided space for people to sleep on the night of the floods and has acted as a storage hub for hundreds of donations of food, clothing, children's toys and cleaning products, from mops to vats of disinfectant.

But people are getting back to normal at different speeds. Some of those who were evacuated are still unable to return. Many homes hum and drone with heaters, dehumidifiers and fans.

Those whose home insurance doesn't cover flood insurance, or who have yet to receive insurance payouts, have received two recovery grants of about £700 in total from Doncaster Council and a local charity, South Yorkshire Community Foundation. According to Peter Trimingham, the response from insurers has been mixed; some people have been paid quickly and have been able to get on with rebuilding, while others have been left arguing about what is covered and what needs to be done.

"It's incredibly stressful because you go from coming downstairs to a flooded house - or worse, you're in a flooded bungalow and left with just the clothes you're stood in. Some people have to wait because the insurance companies are slow - that means you don't get the house cleared, you don't get the dehumidifiers in," he says.

"That's the experience people are going through now. So a natural disaster is followed by a human disaster and that is the point where people are really, really low."

It was Day 21 before Peter's home was fully equipped with dehumidifiers, beginning a process that took weeks. He, his wife Fiona, and their son, Paddy, have just started sleeping there again but the downstairs is a wreck - all the soft furnishings had to go in the skip - and it's not clear when they'll get the final go-ahead from insurers to begin rebuilding.

This feeling of helplessness is leading residents to demand more input in designing solutions. They don't want to see a situation in which Fishlake is safeguarded at the expense of other communities.

"I think we're reactive to flooding and given what's happening we need to become more proactive," says Alison Slack, from Fishlake Cricket Club.

"Putting in a flood defences only means you're going to move a problem somewhere else and I seriously would not want anybody going through what the village has gone through."

One scheme that has caught Peter Trimingham's eye is being piloted in Hull and overseen by Dr Liz Sharp, from the University of Sheffield. It involves rainwater harvesting using water butts in flood areas.

"The project is just finishing now and so far we've just looked at which people will be willing to take water butts for this purpose and a few simple calculations on what impact it would have," says Dr Sharp.

"What we also found is that quite a few of the people we talked to actually said, 'Well, if they were to text us and tell us when to empty our water out, we would empty it to create more capacity.' And people were really willing to do that because they know that they're vulnerable to flooding. They know it's a horrible experience and they want to help other people and prevent that problem."

The element of community engagement in this scheme strongly appeals to Peter Trimingham.

"It's this feeling that you're doing something and that you're contributing to the public good as well as your own good. We just need more ideas like that, that are so simple and that have so much impact for so little cost," he says.

"People can feel they're actually doing something as opposed to the way that we felt in Fishlake. We were flooded and we felt lacking in power. This empowers ordinary people to do something brilliant."

Another scheme he's interested in has taken root in Sheffield, and unlike earlier flood defence measures it could actually slow down the speed at which run-off enters the Don and bears down on Fishlake. It's a project to transform semi-redundant roads into a network of flower meadows and wetlands, and also footpaths to increase access to the riverside district.

At Porter Brook, in the heart of the city, river plants are now blooming in a small section of the waterway, where a "pocket park" has been created.

"In the event of the floods this space will hold the water," says Ian Rotherham. He pays tribute to "enlightened" city council planners and developers.

"It's created a gorgeous little spot. You can come here in spring, you can hear birds singing, you will see kingfishers, we have got trout back in the river. We've got salmon spawning this year, in the upper reaches of the River Don. That's brilliant."

These projects give Peter Trimingham hope that something good can come out of what's happened to his community. He wants more coherent government planning on water management, rather than a series of reactions to individual crises.

"It's got to start in Westminster. We make decisions about planning, we make decisions about water, and we've got to stop treating it as the enemy that comes over the bank," he says.

"It needs to be the friend and we need to look after it."

   Image caption Rebekah was the only single woman at her ayahuasca retreat

The psychedelic powers of a traditional Amazonian plant medicine called ayahuasca are attracting more and more tourists. It's said to bring spiritual enlightenment and to help with addiction, depression and trauma. But a string of allegations suggests there's a darker side to the ayahuasca scene.

Warning: this article contains details of alleged sexual assaults

Rebekah first tried ayahuasca on a "complete whim" when she was travelling in Peru in 2015.

"I thought it sounded interesting and I thought I might as well give it a try," says Rebekah, a New Zealander in her 20s who asked the BBC not to use her surname. "So I found a retreat centre that I felt was good and I just went for it and it was amazing."

Ayahuasca can induce visions of things like serpents, palaces, and alien beings - and bring up long-forgotten memories. Like many who've drunk the brew, Rebekah has a wide-eyed distant look as she reminisces about the experience.

"It was like being guided very gently and very kindly through some really awful experiences that I'd had in the past," Rebekah says. "And returning back home after that, I felt like my relationships were a lot stronger. I felt it was a lot easier to share and receive love.

"They do say that ayahuasca is like 20 years of psychotherapy. And I completely believe that."

Ayahuasca is usually taken in ceremonies at night, led by a healer - sometimes called a shaman. He or she will drink the sticky brown liquid - a brew of two Amazonian plants - then dole out helpings to the participants.

It's been used by tribes in the Amazon region for centuries but now there's a boom in what's become known as "ayahuasca tourism", with ever more specialist retreat centres opening. Travellers often come for help dealing with mental health problems - and a growing body of scientific research suggests ayahuasca could be an effective treatment.

About half an hour or so into a ceremony, the medicine takes its effect and the healer will start singing sacred chants, known as icaros, which guide the participants through their visions. Drinkers usually "purge" during ceremonies too, vomiting and sometimes getting diarrhoea as well.

When Rebekah went on her first ayahuasca retreat, she was the only single woman there and noticed that the male healer was paying her special attention.

"How he treated me was very different, which I didn't find suspicious at the time. But upon reflection, now I do."

A year later, by now a more experienced ayahuasca drinker, Rebekah returned to the same retreat in Peru. The same healer was leading the ceremonies.

Once again, she says, she was treated differently from everyone else. There was a lot of flattery. Then the healer began confiding in Rebekah.

"He constantly told me that he had a lot of troubles," she says, "and he said he was having problems with his wife, that he wasn't sexually fulfilled, and that I was the one who was able to cure him of that."

Rebekah was 20 at the time; the healer in his 50s.

"He also promised me a lot of spiritual advancement or a lot of spiritual power, if we had a relationship - while his wife was down the road."

Rebekah says the healer sexually abused her, coercing her into sexual acts.

"It's disgusting," she says. "Because he was a shaman, I thought he had moral superiority in a sense and I trusted him."

After she was abused, Rebekah left the centre - and the country: "I booked a flight and got the hell out of there."

She was left with a tangle of painful emotions: "Disgust, repulsion, betrayal - confusion, as well as to why a guide would do this, why a teacher would do this and why they would exploit their power like that."

Rebekah's alleged abuser is still the head shaman at his centre - which gets five-star ratings on review sites.

"He is still there," Rebekah says, clearly deeply angered by the situation. Her hands are visibly shaking. "There are other centres that I know of as well that are still operating. There've been multiple women that have been sexually abused in these centres."

Experiences of sexual abuse seem to be widespread in this world. We've heard numerous allegations against numerous healers and read many testimonies of sexual abuse on online forums.

One name that comes up repeatedly is Guillermo Arévalo, a well-known healer who's been honoured by the Peruvian Congress for his work on sustainable development.

"He came to Canada many times," says a woman in her 40s whom we're calling Anna.

"It was quite lucrative - big ceremonies. They'd fill up fast, people paying C$300 (£175) to come and sit with Guillermo. He had kind of a status. It was an honour to sit in ceremony with him."

Anna, who had long been interested in alternative medicine, hoped ayahuasca might help her deal with her addiction to heroin.

At first, she was impressed by Arévalo.

"Like a lot of people, you're flabbergasted by the man's presence and power and ability to lead the ceremony - it's quite profound," she says. "The chanting. He is a good healer."

But a ceremony about seven years ago dramatically changed Anna's opinion.

"It was completely pitch black, the room had no windows. There were a lot of people.

"I was under the effects of the medicine. When you're under the effects there's lots of different sounds. People are crying, verbalising things that make no sense at all, purging or moaning.

"Even if I had been able to say something, nobody would respond."

Anna was having a difficult time. She recalls lying down, moaning and groaning. "Guillermo came and he sat with me and at first it was a sense of relief because I think I'm going to get some help," she says.

"He started to chant to me and put his hands on my stomach over my clothing which is normal. And then he put his hands down my pants. And there's this sense of feeling frozen. I lay there in fear and then he put his hands up my shirt and felt around my breasts."

She remembers thinking: "'What the heck was that all about?' Just a sense of disbelief and confusion."

It's taken six years for Anna to feel able to speak out about what happened to her.

"Women are conditioned to accept this behaviour. For myself, coming from a history of addiction - and I've had abusive relationships with men that I've tolerated in my life - and a history of childhood sexual abuse, there's a sense of familiarity there, of normalcy.

"And also this weird co-dependent relationship for me where the medicine was helping me so I didn't want to speak up because I was afraid I would be ostracised from the community and then I would be kind of cut off from the medicine."

Risks and benefits?

While preliminary scientific studies have suggested that ayahuasca could have therapeutic benefits, it contains DMT, which is illegal in the UK, and there are potential risks.

A 2015 report found six volunteers with depression showed a decrease in symptoms after taking it. A separate study two years later indicated that it held promise as a treatment for eating disorders. Psychologists have also speculated that it could help those with PTSD.

The Foreign and Commonwealth Office warns that some people have "suffered serious illnesses and in some cases death" after taking part in ayahuasca ceremonies. It points out that retreats are typically some distance from populated areas and that while some have basic medical facilities, others do not.

Could ayahuasca have health benefits?

Around the same time, a group calling themselves Ayahuasca Community Awareness Canada - which included senior academics - put their names to a letter about Arévalo's behaviour and circulated it within the ayahuasca scene. The letter-writers say they took action because of the number of complaints made against the healer, citing reports of non-consensual or inappropriate sexual behaviour.

When further named signatories were added to the letter in 2015 and it was made public, Arévalo stopped visiting Canada to lead ayahuasca ceremonies.

But when we track him down it seems he's been active all around the world in the intervening years and is now based at a retreat centre in Peru. The place used to be called Anaconda but when we're there has its first group of foreign guests under a new name, Bena Shinan.

They're milling around in a dining room behind us when we put the allegations of sexual abuse to Arévalo, a slight 71-year-old with silver hair and gold teeth.

Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Guillermo Arévalo in 2004

"I don't accept the allegations because they're not true," he says firmly. "Because sometimes people just imagine these things."

He says he's heard about the letter by members of the Canadian ayahuasca community, but has never read it.

"It doesn't interest me because the allegations aren't true," he says. "It doesn't bother me because I don't think an allegation's going to kill me."

The claims against him, he says, are "the imaginings of the unwell person".

"When you touch someone who's been abused or raped, they think you're the same. That's what happens. That's how I make sense of it."

When we put Anna's specific allegation to him, he says he doesn't remember ever touching a patient during a ceremony in Canada, saying she too must have imagined it.

"What else is he going to do other than just lie and deny it," Anna responds. "Otherwise he would have to step up and take responsibility and be accountable for the way he has acted."

What about his claim that she just imagined the sexual assault?

"It sounds like gaslighting to me, really," she says. "That's what it feels like."

Although Arévalo denies having sexually abused anyone, he does admit that healers working under him have had sex with "unwell people".

He says he no longer works with those healers, but that in some cases it was the patients who initiated the relationships.

"Western women, when they come, they're also seeking out healers," he says.

Image caption Ayahuasca on sale at Belén Market in Iquitos, Peru

Anna's experience with ayahuasca and abuse doesn't end with Guillermo Arévalo. Despite her experiences with him, she didn't want to give up the benefits she received from the brew and continued taking it under the guidance of other healers.

She says that in 2014 she was raped in ayahuasca ceremonies in Peru by a healer who is a member of Arévalo's extended family.

She says again she "just froze" and "let him do whatever he wanted to me".

"I think he probably raped me four or five times and I noticed he was doing it to other people."

Afterwards, Anna says she was in shock. She doesn't remember much about that period of her life.

"I started to develop symptoms of psychosis and ended up relapsing and becoming addicted to fentanyl and overdosed and almost died. I think I really blamed myself for a long time - why I couldn't say no, why I couldn't move, why I let him do those things. Those were the things that were going through my mind."

We've spoken to another guest who was at the same retreat as Anna, who says the healer was later sacked from the centre, because of allegations made by other clients. We're not naming him because, despite our best efforts, we haven't been able to reach him to give him the chance to respond to the allegations.

Emily Sinclair, a British doctoral student researching ayahuasca, is part of a group trying to raise awareness about the problem of sexual abuse in the ayahuasca world.

Working with the Chacruna Institute, an organisation set up to share research on plant medicines and psychedelics, Sinclair helped put together the Ayahuasca Community Guide for the Awareness of Sexual Abuse.

The guidelines highlight typical scenarios in which abuse happens. They also encourage people to drink with trusted companions and to research retreats by checking out review websites before they visit.

Sinclair has been distributing the little green booklet to cafes, tourism offices and ayahuasca centres in the Iquitos area of Peru, known as the hub of ayahuasca tourism.

"A lot of abuse we've found occurs in the context of individual healings where a woman might be asked to remove her clothes unnecessarily," she says. "And when she's in this unfamiliar context, she doesn't know if that's normal or not."

Sinclair points out that it's not just indigenous healers abusing Westerners. "Abuse happens across cultures and within them," she says.

"But one of the big problems is that a lot of people who come here romanticise shamans. So we put them on a pedestal. And it's very easy for that image to be taken advantage of.

"There's also assumptions that some of the people here may have about Western women and culture."

Some of the red flags Sinclair warns people to watch out for echo Rebekah's experience.

Information and Support

"If he's overly touchy with you, he tells you his wife doesn't mind him having sex with other women, he encourages pacts of silence and secrecy between you, he says he wants to teach you 'love magic'. This kind of thing. And also that having sex with them will increase their power and energy. These are all things that have been reported to us as being said to women in this context."

Those affected by sexual abuse understandably find it difficult to talk about openly. On top of that, there's a strong sense within the ayahuasca world that any kind of negative publicity could result in government intervention, which creates an additional pressure to stay silent.

But Rebekah and Anna are speaking out because they hope it will prevent other women being abused.

"I think the only thing we can do is just speak out about it and talk about it," Rebekah says, "make sure people know that it's happening."

Rebekah says that after she was abused there's been "a lot of sadness and a lot of therapy".

It's been hard work for her to trust a healer again, but now she's back in Peru, taking ayahuasca and researching her master's thesis on indigenous medicine.

"Regardless of everything that happened, obviously ayahuasca's great," Rebekah laughs, "because I keep going back to it."

In 2016, Harvey Weinstein hired a private intelligence firm to spy on a long list of people - including those accusing him of sexual assault.

Seth Freedman was one of the operatives on that mission.

Posing as a journalist, he called high-profile people like actress Rose McGowan to extract information that he fed back to Weinstein.

He spoke to the BBC in his first filmed interview about his work for Weinstein and his thoughts on #MeToo.

The allegations against Harvey Weinstein include rape and sexual assault relating to two unnamed accusers.

Mr Weinstein denies all charges against him and insists and sexual encounters were consensual.

   'Why can't I find an Afro-Caribbean egg donor?'

When Natasha and her husband had difficulty conceiving a child, doctors gave her two pieces of bad news. The first was that she would need to find a donor egg. The second was that Afro-Caribbean eggs are rarely donated. But she hasn't given up hope.

Natasha is 38 and is struggling to have a baby.

She got married in 2011, and started trying to conceive immediately. Eventually it became clear there was a problem.

"I actually had four rounds of IVF treatment and obviously none of them were successful. And after the third round the doctor said, 'We doubt that your eggs are going to be any good and you probably need to consider going down the egg donation route.' And she literally got up from her seat and said, 'I'll give you some time with your husband to discuss,' and she walked out the room. And that was it."

Natasha's next step was to call organisations that might help her obtain a donor egg. One was a donation bank.

"They basically said, 'We're going to have to be honest with you, but we don't have many black Afro-Caribbean egg donors come forward.' They told me straight and I appreciated the honesty rather than being sent on a goose chase."

Natasha then cast her net further afield. A clinic in Spain offered her an egg donated by an African. Many might think this was not a bad solution, but Natasha was not sure it would be right for her.

"My heritage is Caribbean. My grandparents on both sides of the family are both from the Caribbean… it was important to me to at least have some cultural connection with the child, and I felt that if it was from a different heritage, I may not…"

She also felt that her family, which she says "has a big hang-up about who looks like who", might discriminate against a child that they knew had come from a donor.

In 2017, about 1,900 individual donors donated eggs in the UK. Of these only 15 were categorised as "Black Caribbean". Twenty were Black African. The vast majority - 1,608 - were White.

As Black Caribbeans make up 1.1% of the population according to the 2011 census, you might expect 21 out of the 1,900 donors to have come from this group. Black Africans, meanwhile, make up 1.8%, so if 2017's donor eggs had been evenly distributed by race, there would have been 34.

Dr Edmond Edi-Osagie, a reproductive medicine specialist in Cheshire says that there is "something cultural within the black community" that makes women reluctant to donate eggs.

"Any time I see an Afro-Caribbean woman over the age of 35 who walks through my clinic, the first thing I think about is, 'Are they going to need donor eggs?' My heart really sinks, because I know that it's going to be a really difficult battle if they are," he says.

He also finds that Afro-Caribbean women are more likely to need donor eggs, than white women of a similar age.

"The reasons for that we're still not very clear about, and there are many plausible reasons, but that's what we are finding anecdotally."

Edi-Osagie has been to a number of black organisations and black churches to talk about the lack of donor eggs and the message always goes down well, he says.

"I get a line of people who wait to speak to me to give me their contact details and then I get my staff, over the following weeks, to try to contact all of those people - and unfortunately, almost invariably that's where the trail ends," he says.

Natasha thinks that one reason so few eggs are donated could be that women don't know there is a shortage.

"There's no awareness, no-one's printed any leaflets - it's not sitting in the waiting rooms of any hospitals," she says.

She also thinks it's a taboo subject that is rarely discussed in the black community.

If the subject is ever mentioned, it's a throwaway comment like, "Sandra up the road, she cannot have a baby," Natasha says.

"It's never taken seriously about how that person must be feeling or what support they may need. It's just not a topic that's ever brought up and yes it does need to change, it really does," she says. "Especially because women, no matter what cultural background, are having children later. So I know I'm not going to be the only person that has gone through this."

Natasha admits she hasn't told her own family about her fertility problems.

In fact, she doesn't even think her husband is aware of the toll they are taking on her.

"He is a very practical man… all on my own."

She says she has to "wear a mask" so that people don't see how she is feeling when something they've said makes her emotions almost brim over.

Image copyright Nadia Akingbule

This doesn't surprise counselling psychotherapist Helen George who, in the course of her research into why older Afro-Caribbean women rarely seek therapy, has heard many say, "You don't talk your business to people."

She's keen to encourage the black community to talk more about infertility, but also to encourage the health system to discuss infertility in a more inclusive way.

"I feel that when we look at the whole landscape of infertility and the services out there, you know, it doesn't represent us," she says.

She had noticed online an event in London called Fertility Fest, which describes itself as "the world's first arts festival dedicated to fertility, infertility, the science of making babies and modern families", and found herself thinking, "it's kind of all white people".

But in 2019 it ran a session on race, religion and reproduction, and she took part.

"The taboo, the stigma, not talking about it in communities, that all came out," she says. "Religion was another one… religion in terms of being angry at God, being angry at not getting what they want."

But she came away with the feeling that the conversation had started. "There was a room full of people of colour all talking about it. People are finding their voice now."

Natasha is on a waiting list for an Afro-Caribbean donated egg. She doesn't know how long she will have to wait. "I need to build up my inner strength to be able to go forward with this again," she says. "I know my age is against me."

She also wants to start raising awareness about this issue in her community in the hope that this will encourage more women to donate eggs - not just for her benefit but for the general good.

It frustrates her that the Human Fertilisation and Embryology Authority, which is aware of the shortage of certain eggs doesn't try to alert the public to this fact. The HFEA points out that it is a regulator, and that this role doesn't fall within its regulatory charter.

And she thinks that more could be done to point out to women that although donating an egg is not a simple procedure - it involves numerous medical tests and you have to inject yourself with hormones twice a day - donors are compensated with a one-off payment of £750.

"I feel that I need to start the ball rolling and maybe being that voice that is knocking on the door, and actually steering this conversation further and making people more aware that this is a problem - because I'm sure that most people wouldn't even consider that this problem even exists."

   H2Go Power seeks to power drones with a 'happy gas'

When you think about hydrogen and flight, the image that comes to mind for most is the Hindenburg airship in flames.

But in a lab deep in the basement of Imperial College in London, a young team has built what it believes is the future of air travel.

H2Go Power is seeking a patent to store the explosive gas cheaply and safely.

Until now, storing hydrogen required ultra-strong and large tanks which could withstand pressures of up to 10,000 pound-force per square inch (psi). That is hundreds of times greater than what you would find in a car tyre.

But, while studying for her PhD in Cambridge, Dr Enass Abo-Hamed came up with a revolutionary structure which could store hydrogen as a stable solid without compression.

"The pressure involved is similar to what you'd get in a coffee machine," she says.

The university paired her with materials scientist, Luke Sperrin, to try to find commercial applications for the innovation - and H2Go Power was born.

Test flight

Dr Sperrin is now chief technology officer. He and Dr Abo-Hamed formed a partnership with Canadian hydrogen fuel cell maker Ballard a year ago to create a drone which used their reactor to safely store hydrogen for flight.

Finally, after months of collaboration by phone and email, Mr Sperrin and chief product developer Peter Italiano flew to Boston for a ground-breaking test flight.

"Of course you need really good weather to fly a drone," smiles Mr Sperrin.

"And it poured with rain for the first few days. We weren't even sure whether we'd even be able to go ahead.

"So when it did fly, it was a huge relief."

How it works

The aluminium reactor weighs less than a bag of sugar.

The small gas cylinder has an intricate network of 3D-printed aluminium tubes inside.

The hydrogen remains stable and solid in these structures until "coolant" is pumped through the tubes, warming them and releasing hydrogen gas to the drone's fuel cell

Hydrogen (H2) is pumped into one side of the fuel cell through a catalyst which frees electrons, creating electricity.

Oxygen (O) is then pumped into the other side of the fuel cell and combines with the left over, positively-charged hydrogen atoms (H+).

The only final waste product is water vapour (H2O).

Never-ending supply

Until recently, a major hurdle to affordable hydrogen technologies was the cost of producing hydrogen gas.

Splitting water molecules into hydrogen used a lot of energy which usually came from fossil fuel sources.

However, the widespread availability of renewable energy and improvements in electrolysis - the chemical process of separating elements using electricity - have brought down the financial and environmental cost of producing hydrogen for fuel.

Currently most countries have strict safety rules about flying drones over heavily populated areas.

Collision or technical failure could cause a drone to drop out of the sky.

Lithium-ion (Li-on) batteries are highly flammable, so a crash landing could trigger an explosion.

But, Dr Abo-Hamed points out, even if their drone fell out of the sky, the hydrogen would remain stable in its solid form inside the reactor.

Image copyright H2Go Power Image caption Dr Enass Abo-Hamed got the idea for the hydrogen reactor while working on her PhD

Super fuel

"Hydrogen is a happy gas," continues Dr Abo-Hamed. "It wants to move around."

That's what makes it so explosive. But, it also delivers more bang for your buck.

Hydrogen generates three times as much power per kilogram compared to fossil fuels - approximately 39.0 Kilowatt hours per kilogram compared with roughly 13 kWh per kg for kerosene or petrol or just 0.2 kWh for conventional lithium ion batteries.

That means a hydrogen-powered drone can fly further than a battery-powered drone and, potentially, carry heavier loads.

Dr Abo-Hamed is excited about the possibilities for her innovation.

"So if drones could stay longer in the sky, they can deliver medicine," she says. "Or scan a disaster area and send the information back.

"My dream really is not just to make drones.

"Maybe in the next twenty or thirty years we could de-carbonise air travel, which is something really important for our climate."

   Researchers: Are we on the cusp of an ‘AI winter’?

The last decade was a big one for artificial intelligence but researchers in the field believe that the industry is about to enter a new phase.

Hype surrounding AI has peaked and troughed over the years as the abilities of the technology get overestimated and then re-evaluated.

The peaks are known as AI summers, and the troughs AI winters.

The 10s were arguably the hottest AI summer on record with tech giants repeatedly touting AI's abilities.

AI pioneer Yoshua Bengio, sometimes called one of the "godfathers of AI", told the BBC that AI's abilities were somewhat overhyped in the 10s by certain companies with an interest in doing so.

There are signs, however, that the hype might be about to start cooling off.

"I have the sense that AI is transitioning to a new phase," said Katja Hofmann, a principal researcher at Microsoft Research in Cambridge.

Given the billions being invested in AI and the fact that there are likely to be more breakthroughs ahead, some researchers believe it would be wrong to call this new phase an AI winter.

Robot Wars judge Noel Sharkey, who is also a professor of AI and robotics at Sheffield University, told the BBC that he likes the term "AI autumn" - and several others agree.

'Feeling of plateau'

At the start of the 2010s, one of the world leaders in AI, DeepMind, often referred to something called AGI, or "artificial general intelligence" being developed at some point in the future.

Machines that possess AGI - widely thought of as the holy grail in AI - would be just as smart as humans across the board, it promised.

DeepMind's lofty AGI ambitions caught the attention of Google, who paid around £400m for the London-based AI lab in 2014 when it had the following mission statement splashed across its website: "Solve intelligence, and then use that to solve everything else."

Several others started to talk about AGI becoming a reality, including Elon Musk's $1bn AI lab, OpenAI, and academics like MIT professor Max Tegmark.

In 2014, Nick Bostrom, a philosopher at Oxford University, went one step further with his book Superintelligence. It predicts a world where machines are firmly in control.

But those conversations were taken less and less seriously as the decade went on. At the end of 2019, the smartest computers could still only excel at a "narrow" selection of tasks.

Gary Marcus, an AI researcher at New York University, said: "By the end of the decade there was a growing realisation that current techniques can only carry us so far."

He thinks the industry needs some "real innovation" to go further.

"There is a general feeling of plateau," said Verena Rieser, a professor in conversational AI at Edinburgh's Herriot Watt University.

One AI researcher who wishes to remain anonymous said we're entering a period where we are especially sceptical about AGI.

"The public perception of AI is increasingly dark: the public believes AI is a sinister technology," they said.

For its part, DeepMind has a more optimistic view of AI's potential, suggesting that as yet "we're only just scratching the surface of what might be possible".

"As the community solves and discovers more, further challenging problems open up," explained Koray Kavukcuoglu, its vice president of research.

"This is why AI is a long-term scientific research journey.

"We believe AI will be one of the most powerful enabling technologies ever created - a single invention that could unlock solutions to thousands of problems. The next decade will see renewed efforts to generalise the capabilities of AI systems to help achieve that potential - both building on methods that have already been successful and researching how to build general-purpose AI that can tackle a wide range of tasks."

'Far to go'

While AGI isn't going to be created any time soon, machines have learned how to master complex tasks like:

playing the ancient Chinese board game Go

identifying human faces

translating text into practically every language

spotting tumours

driving cars

identifying animals.

The relevance of these advances was overhyped at times, says ex-DeepMinder Edward Grefenstette, who now works in the Facebook AI Research group as a research scientist.

Image copyright Facebook Image caption Edward Grefenstette is a research scientist at Facebook in London

"The field has come a very long way in the past decade, but we are very much aware that we still have far to go in scientific and technological advances to make machines truly intelligent," he said.

"One of the biggest challenges is to develop methods that are much more efficient in terms of the data and compute power required to learn to solve a problem well. In the past decade, we've seen impressive advances made by increasing the scale of data and computation available, but that's not appropriate or scalable for every problem.

"If we want to scale to more complex behaviour, we need to do better with less data, and we need to generalise more."

Neil Lawrence, who recently left Amazon and joined the University of Cambridge as the first DeepMind-funded professor of machine learning, thinks that the AI industry is very much still in the "wonder years".

Reality check

So what will AI look like at the end of the 20s, and how will researchers go about developing it?

"In the next decade, I hope we'll see a more measured, realistic view of AI's capability, rather than the hype we've seen so far," said Catherine Breslin, an ex-Amazon AI researcher.

The term "AI" became a real buzzword through the last decade, with companies of all shapes and sizes latching onto the term, often for marketing purposes.

"The manifold of things which were lumped into the term "AI" will be recognised and discussed separately," said Samim Winiger, a former AI researcher at Google in Berlin.

"What we called 'AI' or 'machine learning' during the past 10-20 years, will be seen as just yet another form of 'computation'".

   Microsoft ends Windows 7 support: What should you do?

Cyber-security experts are urging Windows 7 users to upgrade their operating system.

Microsoft is going to stop supporting Windows 7 from Tuesday so that it can focus on "newer technologies".

As a result, Windows 7 users will no longer receive the all-important security updates and patches that keep their machines safe.

One in four Windows users is running Windows 7, according to statistics website StatCounter.

What does this all mean?

It means that Microsoft is ending the cat-and-mouse game with hackers seeking to exploit software bugs in the Windows 7 operating system.

If perpetrators find a flaw in Windows 7, Microsoft will not fix it.

Without continued software and security updates, Windows 7 machines are more likely to be infected with viruses and malware, Microsoft wrote on its website.

"Running an unpatched machine means that the flaws in the code will never be fixed and as exploits for those flaws become known and widespread, your chances of being successfully attacked grow very rapidly," said Rik Ferguson, vice-president of security research at Trend Micro.

David Emm, a senior security researcher at Kaspersky Lab, added that people need to move to a supported operating system as soon as possible.

What are the risks?

Hackers use malware to invade, damage or disable computers.

It can be used to steal personal and financial data, spy on other users without them knowing, and to hold companies to ransom until a payment is made.

In May 2017, the NHS was hit by the WannaCry ransomware attack.

A government report in 2018 concluded that the attack could have been avoided if NHS Trusts had updated their computers and applied the necessary security patches.

Hackers exploited weaknesses in unpatched versions of Windows 7, as well as to a lesser extent the earlier Windows XP, which Microsoft had stopped supporting.

What should you do with your Windows 7 PC?

Computers running Windows 7 will still function after Tuesday but they will become less and less secure.

Microsoft is urging people to move to Windows 10, a newer operating system that it sells for £120.

"Going forward, the best way for you to stay secure is on Windows 10," it said. "And the best way to experience Windows 10 is on a new PC."

It is possible to install Windows 10 on old PCs but Microsoft warns that it may not run smoothly.

In order to run Windows 10, PCs must have a 1GHz processor, 16GB of hard drive space, and 1GB of RAM memory.

"While it is possible to install Windows 10 on your older device, it is not recommended," Microsoft said.

That said, Windows 7 users do not need to upgrade if they use their PC offline.

What do UK officials say?

UK authorities have warned Windows 7 users not to do internet banking or send emails after Tuesday.

The warning was issued by the National Cyber Security Centre, which is part of Britain's intelligence agency GCHQ, and first reported by The Telegraph,.

"We would urge those using the software after the deadline to replace unsupported devices as soon as possible, to move sensitive data to a supported device and not to use them for tasks like accessing bank and other sensitive accounts," an NCSC spokesperson told the BBC.

"They should also consider accessing email from a different device."

What about for businesses?

Some companies rely heavily on applications that only work with Windows 7.

Businesses can pay Microsoft if they want to continue getting updates for Windows 7 Professional or Windows 7 Enterprise.

The Windows 7 Extended Security Updates will be available until 2023 for businesses of all sizes.

Charges range from $25 (£19) per device to $200 per device and increase each year. The costs will mount quickly for organisations with lots of computers.

For businesses, it is not always easy to upgrade to a newer operating system, Mr Ferguson said.

"There may be business-critical applications that will not run on newer operating systems, or there may be significant costs associated with upgrading those applications," he said.

Places like hospitals and factories may have equipment that is designed to run exclusively on Windows 7.

"The user is not always able to upgrade without voiding the warranty," said Mr Ferguson.

   Twitter apologises for letting ads target neo-Nazis and bigots

Twitter has apologised for allowing adverts to be micro-targeted at certain users such as neo-Nazis, homophobes and other hate groups.

The BBC discovered the issue and that prompted the tech firm to act.

Our investigation found it possible to target users who had shown an interest in keywords including "transphobic", "white supremacists" and "anti-gay".

Twitter allows ads to be directed at users who have posted about or searched for specific topics.

But the firm has now said it is sorry for failing to exclude discriminatory terms.

Anti-hate charities had raised concerns that the US tech company's advertising platform could have been used to spread intolerance.

What exactly was the problem?

Like many social media companies, Twitter creates detailed profiles of its users by collecting data on the things they post, like, watch and share.

Advertisers can take advantage of this by using its tools to select their campaign audience from a list of characteristics, for example "parents of teenagers", or "amateur photographers".

Image caption Twitter's ads tool had allowed sensitive keywords to be targeted

They can also control who sees their message by using keywords.

Twitter gives the advertiser an estimate for how many users are likely to qualify as a result.

For example, a car website wanting to reach people using the term "petrolhead" would be told that the potential audience is between 140,000 and 172,000 people.

Twitter's keywords were supposed to be restricted.

But our tests showed that it was possible to advertise to people using the term "neo-Nazi".

The ad tool had indicated that in the UK, this would target a potential audience of 67,000 to 81,000 people.

Other more offensive terms were also an option.

How did the BBC test this?

We created a generic advert from an anonymous Twitter account, saying "Happy New Year".

We then targeted three different audiences based on sensitive keywords.

Twitter's website said that ads on its platform would be reviewed prior to being launched, and the BBC's ad initially went into a "pending" state.

But soon afterwards, it was approved and ran for a few hours until we stopped it.

In that time, 37 users saw the post and two of them clicked on a link attached, which directed them to a news article about memes. Running the ad cost £3.84.

Targeting an advert using other problematic keywords seemed to be just as easy to do.

A campaign using the keywords "islamophobes", "islamaphobia", "islamophobic" and '#islamophobic' had a potential to reach 92,900 to 114,000 Twitter users, according to Twitter's tool.

Advertising to vulnerable groups was also possible.

We ran the same advert to an audience of 13 to 24-year-olds using the keywords "anorexic", "bulimic", "anorexia" and "bulimia".

Twitter estimated the target audience amounted to 20,000 people. The post was seen by 255 users, and 14 people clicked on the link before we stopped it.

What did campaigners say?

Hope Not Hate, an anti-extremism charity, said it feared that Twitter's ads could become a propaganda tool for the far-right.

"I can see this being used to promote engagement and deepen the conviction of individuals who have indicated some or partial agreement with intolerant causes or ideas," said Patrik Hermansson, its social media researcher.

The eating disorder charity Anorexia and Bulimia Care added that it believed the ad tool had already been abused.

"I've been talking about my eating disorder on social media for a few years now and been targeted many times with adverts based on dietary supplements, weight loss supplements, spinal corrective surgery," said Daniel Magson, the organisation's chairman.

"It's quite triggering for me, and I'm campaigning to get it stopped through Parliament. So, it's great news that Twitter has now acted."

What did Twitter say?

The social network said it had policies in place to avoid the abuse of keyword targeting, but acknowledged they had not been applied correctly.

"[Our] preventative measures include banning certain sensitive or discriminatory terms, which we update on a continuous basis," it said in a statement.

"In this instance, some of these terms were permitted for targeting purposes. This was an error.

"We're very sorry this happened and as soon as we were made aware of the issue, we rectified it.

"We continue to enforce our ads policies, including restricting the promotion of content in a wide range of areas, including inappropriate content targeting minors."

   'Barnacle' car windscreen clamp sparks student fury

Plans to introduce a new "barnacle" parking fine system at a US university have been put on hold after complaints from students.

The so-called barnacle is a type of car clamp that sticks to the windscreen using suction cups, and releases its grip after the parking fine is paid.

But outraged students at the University of Oklahoma (OU) shared tips for removing it without paying.

The university's parking authority said it would delay its trial of the device.

"The amount of sheer rage festering in my body right now... this is what I'm in thousands of dollars of debt for? I pay how much to go here and you continue to exploit us in ludicrous ways for profit?" said one student on Twitter.

'Convenient'

The university had originally said the scheme would be more "convenient" for students and less expensive than towing away vehicles.

If a driver had failed to pay more than three outstanding fines, a parking warden would attach the barnacle to the windscreen.

The large plastic screen would be held in place with powerful suction cups, and obscure the driver's view.

Driving off with the device attached to the car would sound an alarm and alert the parking warden.

Students would be able to pay their parking fine in an app to release the barnacle, and then return the device to a drop box in the parking garage.

Barnacle chief executive Kevin Dougherty told the BBC that the device was only used when drivers had parked illegally or failed to pay parking fines.

Image copyright Barnacle Image caption The device releases once the parking fine has been paid

He said it was not stuck "randomly" on innocent drivers' vehicles, and he said those who had parked illegally would now face the hassle of being towed.

Several students had complained about the planned trial, and said they had found inventive ways of prising off the barnacle from their cars without having to pay.

One poster on social news site Reddit claimed he had been able to extract a mobile network Sim card from one of the devices, and used it to access the internet for free.

Mr Dougherty said improvements had since been made to the design of the barnacle, and said 40,000 had been deployed and returned without incident.

Campus newspaper the OU Daily said the trial had been suspended (link geoblocked in the EU) while the parking team sought "further input from the OU community".

The university had been renting five of the devices for use on campus.

It said students would be given 30 days' notice if it decided to reintroduce the barnacle system.

   Microsoft makes 'carbon negative' pledge

   Image copyright Microsoft Image caption Satya Nadella said that technology built without principles does more harm than good

Microsoft has pledged to remove "all of the carbon" from the environment that it has emitted since the company was founded in 1975.

Chief executive Satya Nadella said he wanted to achieve the goal by 2050 .

To do so, the company aims to become "carbon negative" by 2030, removing more carbon from the environment than it emits.

That goes beyond a pledge by its cloud-computing rival Amazon, which intends to go "carbon neutral" by 2040.

"When it comes to carbon, neutrality is not enough," said Microsoft president Brad Smith.

"The carbon in our atmosphere has created a blanket of gas that traps heat and is changing the world's climate," he added in a blog.

"If we don't curb emissions, and temperatures continue to climb, science tells us that the results will be catastrophic."

The company also announced it was setting up a $1bn (£765m) climate innovation fund to develop carbon-tackling technologies.

Carbon neutral v carbon negative

When a business says it is carbon neutral, it aims to effectively add no carbon to the atmosphere.

It can do this by:

balancing its emissions, for example by removing a tonne of carbon from the atmosphere for every tonne it has produced

offsetting its emissions, for example by investing in projects that reduce emissions elsewhere in the world

not releasing greenhouse gases in the first place, for example by switching to renewable energy sources

Until now, most companies have focused on offsetting emissions to achieve neutrality.

This often involves funding projects in developing economies to reduce carbon emissions there, for example building hydroelectric power plants, encouraging families to stop using wood-based stoves, and helping businesses make use of solar power. These reductions are then deducted from the main company's own output.

The result of this slows carbon emissions rather than reversing them.

To be carbon negative a company must actually remove more carbon from the atmosphere than it emits.

Microsoft says it will do this using a range of carbon capture and storage technologies.

The announcement was largely welcomed by environmentalists, who said it showed Microsoft was thinking about the bigger climate change picture and not just its own role.

"It's a hat trick of sustainability leadership," said Elizabeth Sturcken from the Environmental Defence Fund.

"But to really shift the needle on climate change, we need 1,000 other [companies] to follow-suit and turn rhetoric into action."

However, Greenpeace warned that Microsoft still needed to address its ongoing relationship with oil and gas companies.

"While there is a lot to celebrate in Microsoft's announcement, a gaping hole remains unaddressed: Microsoft's expanding efforts to help fossil fuel companies drill more oil and gas with machine-learning and other AI technologies," said senior campaigner Elizabeth Jardim.

Microsoft's plan is still more aggressive than those taken by other tech firms, including Facebook, Google, Apple and Amazon, which have not made "carbon negative" commitments.

How will Microsoft achieve its goal?

Microsoft has suggested a range of ways it could remove carbon from the atmosphere, including:

seeding new forests and expanding existing ones

and expanding existing ones soil carbon sequestration - a process of putting carbon back into the ground. This could be achieved by adding microbes and nutrients to parched earth, which should have the added benefits of making the soil more fertile and less susceptible to erosion

- a process of putting carbon back into the ground. This could be achieved by adding microbes and nutrients to parched earth, which should have the added benefits of making the soil more fertile and less susceptible to erosion direct air capture - sucking carbon dioxide out of the atmosphere, possibly by using large fans to move air through a filter that can remove the gas

- sucking carbon dioxide out of the atmosphere, possibly by using large fans to move air through a filter that can remove the gas bio-energy with carbon capture - growing crops and then capturing the CO2 they emit when, for example, they are burned to produce heat or fermented to make fuels such as bioethanol. Negative emissions become possible if the amount of CO2 stored as a result is greater than that emitted during production, transport and use

Tech companies' manufacturing and data-processing centres create large amounts of carbon dioxide.

By one estimate, the sector will account for up to 3.6% of the world's greenhouse gas emissions this year, more than double the level in 2007. And it has been forecast that in a worst-case scenario, this could grow to 14% by 2040.

Microsoft has said it plans to halve emissions created directly by itself and those involved in its supply chain by 2030.

One way the company intends to do this is by increasing the carbon fees it charges its internal business groups.

Since 2012, Microsoft has forced its divisions to set budgets that take account of the cost of emissions created through electricity use, business travel and other activities.

Now that charge will incorporate indirect emissions such as those created by customers using electricity to power the divisions' products.

And since Microsoft cannot avoid producing CO2 altogether, it will invest in technologies to capture and store the gas to reduce the amount in the atmosphere.

Mr Smith said this would involve tech "that doesn't fully exist today".

The firm added that its data centres and other facilities would use 100% renewable energy by 2025.

How do Microsoft's plans compare to rivals?

Software-maker Intuit has also pledged to be carbon negative by 2030.

The Californian company has said it will reduce emissions by 50 times more than its 2018 carbon footprint.

Amazon's Jeff Bezos announced in September 2019 that his company would be carbon neutral by 2040.

His pledge included plans to buy 100,000 electric vehicles for the online retailer's delivery fleet.

Google has launched a set of digital tools to allow cities to track and reduce emissions. The search giant also offsets its own emissions by investing in green projects.

Facebook has issued a cease and desist notice to an Israeli firm that claims to be able to subconsciously alter people's behaviour.

The Spinner charges a fee to "subconsciously influence" targets by exposing them to online posts "disguised as editorial content".

But Facebook has objected to the start-up using its services to achieve this.

And the tech giant has barred the firm and its chief from using Facebook or Instagram for any reason.

In response, the Spinner's co-founder and chief operating officer Elliot Shefler told the BBC that it would continue to sell targeted online campaigns and refused to rule out using Facebook in the future.

Policy violation

The Spinner claims to be able to "brainwash" loved ones to:

quit smoking

lose weight

propose marriage

initiate sex with their partners more often

consider having breast implants

To do this, it shows dozens of articles about the issue to targets over a period of months via the internet, including in their social media feeds.

Facebook's law firm Perkins Coie has sent a letter to Mr Shefler to complain.

"It appears that the Spinner uses fake accounts and fake Facebook Pages to 'strategically bombard' Facebook users with advertisements," it reads.

"These activities violate Facebook's terms and advertising policies. Facebook demands that you stop this activity immediately."

The Californian firm told the BBC that it had already removed the Spinner's accounts.

"We have no tolerance for bad actors that try to circumvent our policies and create bad experiences for people on Facebook," a spokesman said.

Mr Shefler pointed out that the Spinner had bought advertising slots on Facebook for more than a year, and each of its ads had been reviewed and approved.

Facebook uses both humans and automated software to vet ads submitted via its self-service tools.

But Mr Shefler added: "The Spinner's ability to deliver content to targeted users is not dependent on any specific social account or page. It's a concept."

Does it work?

The Spinner operates by sending a link to the target's phone. When opened, it places a small file known as a cookie on the target's device, which allows them to be identified and exposed to specially created articles and other media.

The idea was originally pitched to the public via the crowdfunding site Indiegogo, but only raised £192 of its £47,800 target. Despite this, the firm decided to press on.

But some have questioned whether its methods work.

Rich Leigh, who works in public relations, put it to the test.

He bought a campaign that supposedly encouraged women to want more sex. But instead of sending the link to a friend or loved one, he delivered the campaign to himself.

A few months later, his Facebook feed began to show sponsored posts featuring articles with headlines such as 9 Ways To Initiate Sex.

But he says he only saw only four or five examples. He also reported seeing ads from a campaign he did not purchase, encouraging him to stop riding motorcycles.

Mr Shefler insists the service is legitimate.

"This is not a technical hack," he said.

"We use common tools. The hack is in the pricing. We buy the media for $5 per 1,000 impressions. We sell the media for $49 per 180 impressions. That's a high margin," he said.

Mr Shefler did not refer the BBC to any customers who had previously bought campaigns.

One critic said that while many people might find the Spinner's tactics objectionable, the tracking techniques commonly used by other advertising companies were arguably worse.

"By getting outraged at obvious stuff that the Spinner does, we tend to overlook its true significance," said Doc Searls, author of the The Intention Economy.

"It exemplifies the methods and purposes of the entire online surveillance economy, and the participation of most publishers in that same economy."

   Apple may have to abandon Lightning connector cable

Apple could be forced to abandon its Lightning connector cable if European lawmakers get their way.

The cable is used to charge and sync many Apple devices, such as the iPhone.

But members of the European Parliament urged the European Commission on Monday to force tech giants to adopt a single universal charging method.

Two other charging cables - USB-C and micro-USB - are used on Android devices, and Apple has already stopped using Lightning on the 2018 iPad Pro.

European regulators will vote on the matter on a yet to be determined date, but Apple says the proposed regulation would stifle innovation and be disruptive to consumers.

How likely is this to happen?

If the regulator enforces its proposed regulation, Apple devices sold in Europe would be required to have a new charging method.

It is likely Apple would then adopt USB-C, considering the company's 2018 iPad Pro ditched Lightning in favour of the technology.

Another possible option would be to remove charging ports and cables entirely and use wireless charging instead.

A new cable would mark the tech giant's third in 13 years.

The majority of newly-manufactured Android phones already feature USB-C ports.

Why does the EU want this change?

The European Commission has been campaigning for a single charging method for the past decade.

There were more than 30 types of charger on the market in 2009, but that number has since been reduced to just three.

The regulator is determined to cut down on electronic waste being created by obsolete cables, which it estimates generate more than 51,000 tonnes of waste per year.

"This is hugely detrimental for the environment," said European Parliament member Alex Agius Saliba.

"A common charger should fit all mobile phones, tablets, e-book readers and other portable devices."

Hasn't this happened before?

Apple, along with 10 other leading tech giants such as Nokia and Samsung, signed a memorandum of understanding in 2009.

They pledged to provide micro-USB compatible chargers for consumers.

However, Apple took advantage of a loophole that allowed manufacturers to continue using their own chargers if they offered an adaptor.

Then, in 2014, the EU passed the Radio Equipment Directive, which called for a "renewed effort to develop a common charger".

Apple insisted that its slimmer devices would be unable to fit the then-new USB-C technology, and it claimed it would cost up to $2bn (£1.53bn) to meet the desired standard.

Isn't wireless charging the future anyway?

Apple and many of its rivals, such as Huawei and Samsung, have already released products that charge their devices wirelessly.

Although the technology is in its infancy, new developments have meant that it is now able to compete with traditional charging methods.

Some analysts are even predicting that Apple could scrap its charging ports altogether by releasing future iPhone and iPad models that rely solely on wireless charging.

Smart contact lenses have been a popular concept in films for many years and may now finally have arrived in reality.

Mojo Vision has revealed its new lenses which can display statistics like health tracking and other data feeds using augmented reality. The lenses project light in front of the user’s eye - meaning it can still be seen when their eyes are shut.

The lenses are still in development, but BBC Click’s Lara Lewington got a look at the lens behind closed doors at CES last week.

US-based porn website Girlsdoporn is now offline after being ordered to pay $12.8m (£9.8m) to 22 unnamed women who appeared in videos it published.

The domain has been down for about a week, according to platforms which track whether websites are working.

On 3 January, a judge in San Diego ruled the firm had lied to the women about how the videos would be shared and whether they would be identifiable.

The site's owner Michael Pratt is currently wanted by the FBI.

He is believed to be in New Zealand.

Deceived women win GirlsDoPorn legal battle

Other website addresses connected to the business also appear to be offline, reports Vice.

The site promised videos featuring women who were not professional porn stars, and would therefore only ever appear in one film.

The women who brought the lawsuit were told their videos would not appear online and were intended for private investors or overseas DVDs.

However, they were uploaded to the subscription platform and clips were also circulated to other, free-to-view, sites.

Despite promising its models that their names would not be linked to the material, the site did share identifying information on third party forums, the court found.

"Collectively, [the women] have experienced severe harassment, emotional and psychological trauma, and reputational harm; lost jobs, academic and professional opportunities and family and personal relationships, and had their lives derailed and uprooted," noted San Diego Superior Court Judge Kevin Enright.

   Can Microsoft's 'moonshot' carbon goal succeed?

Tech giant Microsoft has announced two bold ambitions: firstly, to become carbon negative by the year 2030 - meaning it will be removing more carbon from the air than it emits - and secondly, to have removed more carbon by 2050 than it has emitted, in total, in its entire history.

In an interview with the BBC's Chris Fox, Microsoft president Brad Smith admitted that the plan was a "moonshot" - a very big idea with no guaranteed outcome or profitability - for the company.

He stressed there was simultaneously a sense of urgency and a need to take the time to do the job properly.

He also said that the tools required don't entirely exist yet.

Mr Smith talked about tree planting, and direct air capture - a way of removing carbon from the air and returning it to the soil - as examples of available options.

"Ultimately we need better technology," he said.

But don't expect Microsoft to roll up its sleeves: "That's not a business we will ever be in but it's a business we want to benefit from," he added, announcing a $1bn Climate Innovation Fund, established with the intention of helping others develop in this space.

Microsoft makes 'carbon negative' pledge

He expects support from the wider tech sector, he said, "because it's a sector that's doing well, it can afford to make these investments and it should."

Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Microsoft President Brad Smith

But historically, isn't it also one of the worst offenders?

CES in Las Vegas, the huge consumer tech show, has just ended. It was attended by 180,000 people most of whom probably flew there, to look at mountains of plastic devices clamouring to be the Next Big Thing.

From gas-guzzling cars and power-hungry data centres to difficult-to-recycle devices and the constant consumer push to upgrade to new shiny plastic gadgets - the tech sector's green credentials are not exactly a blueprint for environmental friendliness despite much-publicised occasional projects.

There was no immediate announcement from fellow tech giants about any collaborations with Microsoft, or indeed similar initiatives of their own - but the aim is ahead of the current ambitions of many, including Facebook, Google and Apple, which have not (yet) made a "carbon negative" commitment.

That said, software-maker Intuit has pledged to be carbon negative by 2030, and Jeff Bezos announced in September 2019 that Amazon would be carbon neutral by 2040.

Mr Smith made an open offer to share Microsoft's carbon-monitoring tools.

"Competition can make each of us better," he said of the notoriously rivalry-fuelled industry.

"If we make each other better the world is going to be better off and we should applaud each other as we take these new steps."

Mr Smith agreed that "the switching on of an Xbox", Microsoft's games console, was as much part of the firm's carbon footprint as the carbon that went into creating the cement used in its buildings.

However, he did not suggest scaling back on collaborations with the big energy firms - on the contrary, we are going to need more power rather than less in the coming decades, he said - and that has troubled campaigner Greenpeace.

"While there is a lot to celebrate in Microsoft's announcement, a gaping hole remains unaddressed - Microsoft's expanding efforts to help fossil fuel companies drill more oil and gas with machine-learning and other AI technologies," commented senior campaigner Elizabeth Jardim.

Environmental awareness, especially among the under-30s, will ultimately prove to be a big driver for market change, Mr Smith believes.

"I think it's interesting to think about a future where buying a product and understanding how much carbon was emitted to create it is like going to the supermarket and looking at what's on the shelf and seeing how many calories it contains," he said.

   Does your company nurture neurodiverse talent?

How do you make your workplace more welcoming to neurodiverse employees, and ensure their talent is nurtured?

David Joseph takes off his shoes, crosses his legs and tucks himself into an armchair. For the CEO of one of the biggest record labels in the UK - Universal Music UK - he's unassuming. Our interview is supposed to last 10 minutes, but nearly an hour later (and several reminders by his assistant that he has other meetings), David is still talking, with pride, about diversity. Because he wants change. He wants to talk about diversity, especially a hidden diversity that never really gets a look in on any conversation about difference - neurodivergence.

"A defining moment was that I got a text from this artist about three days after I saw them," he says. "This artist has unquestionably changed culture, but the words [in the text] were in the wrong order. I always speak to this person, seen them a lot, worked with them for a long time, but this was the first time I've ever had a text from them. And then I realised why."

Image copyright Universal Music UK Image caption David Joseph is the Chairman and CEO of Universal Music UK

Neurodivergence - also known as neurodiversity - is a term many people may not be familiar with. It refers to the community of people who have dyslexia, dyspraxia, ADHD, are on the autism spectrum, or have other neurological functions.

According to to the conciliation service ACAS, "these are 'spectrum' conditions, with a wide range of characteristics, but which nevertheless share some common features in terms of how people learn and process information".

"Our artists, not all of them, certain ones, definitely think differently," says David. He's not just talking about Florence Welch or Billie Eilish - whose neurodiversity is well documented - he's talking about any employee at the label who is part of the creative process.

An estimated one in seven people are neurodivergent in the UK but this isn't something that is routinely acknowledged in the workplace.

"I need to reinforce that this is interwoven with all the other issues around diversity. It's not like we're picking this one over and above all the others," says David.

This isn't about being nice and just giving people jobs.

"There is an unconscious bias towards hiring people you think you'll get on with, share similar views, and dare I say it, might not be rebellious or cause dissent. I am a big fan of respectful outliers," says David.

"I've been allowed to grow through this company and fundamentally be myself."

After carrying out a fair amount of research, David and his HR team have produced a guidebook that more than 100 companies have expressed an interest in.

It's cream coloured, to make it easier to read for people with dyslexia (the advice is to use dark coloured text on a light - not white - background, and sufficient contrast levels between background and text). It's full of simple graphics and isn't too wordy.

Image caption The Universal Music guide explains some of the active ways they are trying to make their workplace more neurodiverse friendly.

The message is to stop focusing on things that neurodivergent people can't do and start celebrating what they are exceptional at.

It's something that insurance company Direct Line, which actively recruits neurodivergent individuals, has been working on for some time.

"There are so many different strengths that we hold, and I think it's easy to focus on the negatives but you get so much more when you focus on the positives," says Yvonne Akinwande.

Image caption Yvonne Akinwande

The 31-year-old marketing consultant says her employer recognises the need to ensure the working environment is suited to neurodiverse employees.

She says that because of her dyslexia, she mixes up certain letters and doesn't easily recognise errors, such as spelling, punctuation and grammar.

But the company has given her specific software to help with recording and writing up meeting notes. And even simple things, from the colour of her notepads to situating her desk in a quieter part of the office, has helped create a comfortable environment.

More importantly, she feels that the more creative marketing role that she now holds suits her skill set more than the one she held previously.

"In my previous role we would be audited monthly on our work. One of the things that would continuously come out was my grammar and spelling mistakes. We would need to send out formal correspondence to customers, and if they included car registrations, for instance, I would mix up letters.

"All these things would mean I was marked down. It made me feel negative in terms of my capabilities, which is not normal for me because I am very confident and very positive about what I can bring to the table.

"I needed a role that highlighted and praised the skills that I do have that can be beneficial to the company."

Yvonne is co-lead of a neurodiversity strand that has been created within the business.

But increasingly more businesses are realising the benefits of employing neurodiverse individuals.

Change your processes

Intelligence agency GCHQ is proud of what it has described as its "mix of minds".

"Without neurodiversity, we wouldn't be GCHQ," it says in a statement.

It is another employer that actively recruits neurodivergent people, and has been doing so for more than 20 years.

Image copyright Getty Images Image caption The Government Communications Headquarters, also known as GCHQ, Cheltenham

It is the ability to focus and find links and patterns, among other things, that is attractive about people in this community.

The spy agency, which works alongside MI5, MI6 and law enforcement, will soon open a site in Manchester that has been designed with special adjustments to support neurodiverse staff.

It already makes things like noise-cancelling headphones and voice-to-text and text-to-voice software available.

"Some of our most talented and creative people have a neurodiverse profile - from autism spectrum condition to dyslexia, and from dyscalculia and dyspraxia. Our apprentices are three to four times more likely to have dyslexia than the national average," the statement says.

GCHQ examples of workplace adjustments can Include:

Mind mapping software

Noise cancelling headphones

Voice to text/Text to voice software

On-screen reading rulers

GCHQ examples of typical adjustments at interview:

Taking notes and mind maps into interview

Having extra time to compensate for slower processing speed

Not being asked multiple questions at the same time

Using a whiteboard or flipchart to "car park" questions to return to later

Recruitment agency Exceptional Individuals is made up of a team of neurodivergent individuals who understand the challenges that even a job interview can pose for people like themselves.

They help with CVs, filling out applications, interview prep, and maintain a relationship with that person to make sure they have longevity in their job.

Image copyright Exceptional individuals Image caption Graph showing the differences between the skillset of someone who may be dyslexic in comparison to someone considered neurotypical.

They also work with businesses to help them make their workplace more inclusive, and educate and inform staff on working in a neurodiverse workplace.

"Employers are using processes that are quite dated, which is screening talent out," founder Matt Boyd says. So, he says, if you are bad at spelling and get something wrong on an application form, you're not going to be considered for the job.

"People with autism, for example, because of how they can communicate in an interview and how that's perceived, are often not considered for the role or taken onto the next round.

"There are lots of challenges that people with ADHD, dyslexia, dyspraxia and autism come up against just because employers don't understand and don't have processes in place."

And that process could be something as simple as how a job ad is worded.

For Direct Line's Yvonne, key to getting her dream job was that the advert didn't specify something like: "Must be exceptional at written communication".

"I am not exceptional at written communication," she says. "But it did ask for someone who's creative in their mind-set and likes to engage and work with other people. Skills that I possess."

The Office For National Statistics doesn't break down unemployment by neurodiversity, so there are no specific statistics on unemployment among neurodivergent people. But according to the National Autistic Society, only an estimated 16% of autistic people are in full-time employment.

Inexpensive reasonable adjustments

Neurodiversity is protected under the Equality Act 2010, and according to the Department of Work and Pensions, an employer should make "reasonable changes" if someone discloses their neurodiversity.

Making those changes doesn't have to be costly. The government's Access to Work Scheme allows employers to access money for any "extra disability related costs of working that are beyond standard reasonable adjustments people have when starting work or maintaining employment".

But for David, back at Universal, as we chat, he smiles at the strides his company has made in this area.

"Part of our job is to meet a lot of people. And we sometimes sit with them and notice that that was like the same person 12 times. They dressed the same, they talked the same.

"And it makes me feel really proud of what we've got here. We really have created, without meaning to a 'come as you are and lets try and make you be the best version of yourself possible' policy. We're creatively curious."

As singer Florence Welch wrote in the Universal Music UK guidebook: "It would be wonderful if people could walk into jobs and be honest about how they move through the world."

A British teenager found guilty of lying about being gang-raped in Cyprus has launched an appeal against her conviction.

The 19-year-old had denied causing public mischief and on Thursday lawyers filed the grounds for her appeal at the supreme court of Cyprus.

She is now back in the UK after receiving a suspended jail term.

Justice Abroad said she did not get a fair trial and the conviction "breaches" her rights.

Michael Polak, director of the legal support group, criticised her treatment and that of her representatives and witness as being in "clear contrast" to the prosecution and its witnesses.

He said the conviction breached Cypriot law and flouted the country's international obligations under the European Convention on Human Rights and as a member of the European Union.

The teenager said she was raped by up to 12 Israeli tourists in a hotel room in the resort town of Ayia Napa on July 17, before being charged herself after signing a retraction statement 10 days later.

She maintains she was raped, but was forced to change her account under pressure from Cypriot police following hours of questioning alone and without legal representation.

She was convicted in December but had vowed to appeal, with her lawyer, Lewis Power QC previously saying the case was "not finished by any means".

She returned to the UK on 8 January after receiving a four-month jail sentence, suspended for three years.

Famagusta District Court also ordered her to pay £125 in legal fees.

The dozen young men and boys, aged between 15 and 20, were freed after their initial arrests and later returned home.

   Construction firm John Laing has built some of the nation's power stations and housing estates, motorways and cathedrals. As Historic England and the John Laing Charitable Trust open the company's picture vault to the public, here are some of the firm's photographs documenting their bigger builds.

The Severn bridge

Image copyright Historic England/John Laing Collection Image caption The second Severn Bridge took four years to build

The second Severn bridge, now known as the Prince of Wales Bridge, opened to traffic on 5 June 1996.

Built to ease pressure on the first Severn bridge, which opened 30 years previously, it carries the six lanes of the M4 between England and Wales with more than 30,000 vehicles using it each day.

Image copyright Historic England/John Laing Collection Image caption It is three miles (4.8km) long and crosses the River Severn

It took four years to build the three mile (4.8km) span.

A toll that had been in place since the first bridge opened in 1966 was abolished in December 2018.

M1 and M6

The 1950s and 60s saw the creation and expansion of Britain's motorway network.

John Laing helped build stretches of both the M1 and M6.

Construction of the M6 also saw John Laing employ its first female civil engineer, 21-year-old London University student Kik Hong Ong.

The M6 incorporates the country's first stretch of motorway, the Preston by-pass, which opened in 1958, on its journey from Rugby to Gretna.

Meanwhile, the 193-mile long M1 connects London to Leeds and was built mainly between 1959 and 1968.

Coventry Cathedral

Image copyright Historic England/John Laing Collection Image caption Coventry's new cathedral was built close to the remains of its old one

On 14 November 1940, St Michael's Cathedral in Coventry was practically obliterated by bombs dropped by the Luftwaffe.

As the smoke and dust cleared, all that remained was the tower and spire, outer wall and tomb of its first bishop.

The new, modernist cathedral was built between 1956 and 1962 a stone's throw away from where the shell of the bombed building still stands.

It was designed by Basil Spence and built by John Laing, with construction including the use of a helicopter to place the cathedral's tower.

Barbican estate

The 40-acre Barbican estate was built in the 1960s close to London's old city wall on a site flattened by World War Two bombing.

Hailed as a fine example of brutalist concrete architecture, it is comprised of flats, an arts centre, school and the Museum of London.

It is home to about 4,000 people and was built to tackle a shortfall in housing in that part of London after the war.

The Queen visited the Barbican on 20 November 1972, the day she celebrated her silver wedding anniversary.

Berkeley Nuclear Power Station

Berkeley, one of the world's first commercial nuclear power stations, was in operation between 1962 and 1989 with its reactors producing enough electricity to power an area the size of Bristol each day.

Image copyright Historic England/John Laing Collection Image caption It was commissioned in 1962 and operated for 27 years

It stood beside the River Severn in Gloucestershire and while many of its buildings have been removed, work is only now starting on removing the nuclear waste.

It will not be safe for humans to go inside its two reactor cores until 2074.

London Central Mosque

The mosque near Regent's Park opened in 1977 and can accommodate more than 5,000 worshippers.

It is also known as the Islamic Cultural Centre.

Image copyright Historic England/John Laing Collection Image caption The dome's exterior was covered in gold-coloured copper alloy

More than 100 designs were submitted for the mosque before Frederick Gibberd's plan was chosen, with construction taking three years.

While the dome's exterior was covered in gold-coloured copper alloy, the interior was lined with an intricate geometric tile mosaic.

A plan to ban car drivers from taking trips across Birmingham city centre has raised questions about taxis, commuting, electric vehicles and emergencies. So how would it actually work?

What is the plan?

Birmingham City Council wants to cut air pollution by allowing cars to travel into the city but not through it.

Under the proposals, drivers entering the centre would have to go back out to the ring road to then get to other areas.

Our story, which outlined the Birmingham Transport Plan 2031, prompted hundreds of readers to get in touch to ask how the changes would impact on specific drivers and circumstances.

Most of these details were not included in the plan as it was a "draft vision document subject to consultation", a council spokesman said.

Here is how we got on with answering your questions.

What does it mean for commuters?

Image copyright WMCA Image caption Sprint buses are planned to replace commuter car journeys

Commuter car parking will be limited in areas like the city centre that are well served by public transport, according to the document.

"Buses, trams and trains will be the backbone of a new, go-anywhere transport system," it said.

"Sprint [bus] services will deliver high-frequency services on main commuter routes with predictable journey times and dependable timetables," the plan stated.

There will be seven routes and three of them will be in place for the Birmingham 2022 Commonwealth Games.

A34 Walsall to Birmingham

A45 Birmingham City Centre to Birmingham Airport and Solihull

Sutton Coldfield to Birmingham via Langley (SBL)

What about taxis?

Image caption New taxi licensing policies have been introduced ready for the 2020 Clean Air Zone

The only mention of taxis in the plan said those "that meet emissions standards will also make a valuable contribution to the integrated transport system".

Birmingham's licensing and public protection committee had already approved new policies to regulate the number and type of taxis and private hire vehicles it will licence from January 2020, it said.

The council's website said it had funding for 197 charging points for electric and hybrid taxis and private hire vehicles in about 80 locations.

These will start being installed this year in the city centre, at Tyseley Energy Park and at a number of locations around the outer circle, it said.

What about electric cars?

The plan said: "Irrespective of advancements in technology, single occupancy private cars will never be able to match the capacity of mass public transport for getting people to where they want to go."

On-street parking spaces would be prioritised for "sustainable forms of transport", it said.

The council plans to replace its 36 public electric car charging points with rapid chargers in more locations starting in early 2020, according to its website.

What about ambulances and people getting to hospital?

Image caption Emergency service vehicles were not mentioned in the plan

Hospital trips or emergency services vehicles were not specifically mentioned in the plan.

However, as the plan prohibits only cross-city trips, patients would be able to drive to a hospital and leave again via the ring road.

Patients would not be able to drive across the city to get to a hospital on the other side, they would have to go around.

What about drivers with disabilities?

Image caption On-street parking spaces would be prioritised for people with disabilities, the plan said

Any decisions over how the plan was rolled out would take into account the needs of motorists with disabilities, the plan said.

The number of disabled parking bays in easily accessible locations would be protected wherever possible, according to the document.

On-street parking spaces would be prioritised for people with disabilities, cyclists, car clubs and other sustainable forms of transport.

"Mobile apps could make it easier, particularly for people with disabilities, to book and pay for transport with a single transaction supporting journeys that combine several modes," it said.

How can I give my thoughts on the plan?

The draft plan is due to go to cabinet on 21 January.

If it is approved by councillors it will go out to public consultation on 28 January until 27 March.

A man living with a behavioural condition says he has the "brain of Einstein" but the "attention span of a two year old".

Stuart, 34, has been describing what it is like living with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), after being diagnosed when he was five years old.

He has been helped by the Lighthouse in Bedfordshire, a volunteer-run support group for people with mental health concerns.

He says the group is a safe space for him if he has "one of my hyper attacks".

According to the NHS, most cases of ADHD are diagnosed between the ages of six and 12, but many people continue to experience difficulties as an adult.

A Buddha statue from an important religious site has been returned to Sri Lanka, 100 years after it was gifted to a British man.

Members of the Bell family have handed this statue down through the generations after archaeologist and explorer Harry Charles Purvis Bell, known as HCP Bell, was given the statue during a visit to a temple in 1919, while he was working in Sri Lanka.

Now HCP Bell's grandson Reverend Kenneth Bell and his daughter Fiona have travelled from their homes in Overton, Hampshire to return the statue to its home inside the Temple of the Tooth in Kandy.

A planting scheme has begun to grow trees that it is hoped will be resistant to ash dieback disease.

Scientists are growing 3,000 saplings in Hampshire and will monitor them for symptoms of the disease, which has devastated ash trees.

The specimens have been propagated from the shoots of trees which have already shown signs of disease tolerance.

The government said it was a "major step towards maintaining and restoring ash in the British landscape".

Ash dieback could eventually kill between 70% and 95% of UK's ash trees, according to separate studies.

The resistant trees were identified at plantations in East Anglia and elsewhere, as part of the government's £1.9m Ash Archive project.

Their shoots were grafted on to rootstocks and planted at an unspecified location in Hampshire by the Future Trees Trust.

The charity said the saplings would be monitored for five years to identify those that were "truly tolerant".

Head of research Jo Clark said: "It's exciting to finally see these trees planted.

"We will ensure we have the most tolerant individuals with which to commence a new breeding programme for ash."

Ash dieback is caused by the fungus Hymenoscyphus fraxineus, which originated in Asia.

In its native range, it causes little damage to trees, but when the fungus was introduced to Europe about 30 years ago, it caused widespread destruction.

In the UK, 70 million trees could be lost, which would cost the economy £15bn, according to a recent analysis..

A British backpacker died after the vehicle she was in hit a patch of loose sand in the road and overturned in Australia, an inquest has heard.

Jade Fox was in a 4x4 which crashed on Fraser Island in Queensland on 31 October 2014.

A friend who had been travelling with her said the 22-year-old "did not feel safe" driving during the trip.

Ms Fox died from positional asphyxia as the result of a road traffic collision, the hearing concluded.

The vehicle, containing six other backpackers and travelling in a convoy, flipped during a three-day "tagalong tour" of the island, the court in Maidstone heard.

It was told the 19-year-old German tourist driving the vehicle had looked down momentarily to change gear, hit the sand patch, then over-corrected the steering, causing the vehicle to overturn.

A police report by the Australian authorities said it had been travelling at about 40-45 km/h (28mph) at the time of the crash.

Ms Fox, from Maidstone in Kent, was the only tourist killed.

Remmi Sexton, who had been travelling with Ms Fox, said she was unhappy she did not have the opportunity to make a statement during the inquest.

She told reporters they had been told to "keep 100 yards between cars", but the leading car was about two miles in front of them, and the lead driver had been telling the other cars to "hurry up".

She said some members of the group had since sued the company and added: "Jade was the only one who didn't drive because she didn't feel safe enough."

Christopher Tolkien, who edited and published the posthumous works of his father, Lord of the Rings writer JRR Tolkien, has died aged 95.

The news was confirmed by the Tolkien Society, which described him as "Middle-earth's first scholar".

After his father's death in 1973, Mr Tolkien published the acclaimed work The Silmarillion.

Scholar Dr Dimitra Fimi said the study of JRR Tolkien "would never be what it is today" without his input.

Christopher Tolkien was born in Leeds, and grew up in Oxford.

After serving in the RAF during World War Two he became a lecturer in Old and Middle English and Old Icelandic at Oxford University.

Image copyright HarperCollins Image caption Christopher Tolkien edited and released The Fall of Gondolin in 2018

Image caption JRR Tolkien made a huge impact on fantasy writing with The Hobbit and The Lord of the Rings

He drew the original maps of Middle-earth seen in The Lord of the Rings books released in the 1950s.

He later became the literary executor of the Tolkien Estate, completing several books set in the world of Middle-earth using his father's material from 70 boxes of unpublished work.

Tolkien Society chairman Shaun Gunner said: "Christopher's commitment to his father's works has seen dozens of publications released... we have lost a titan and he will be sorely missed."

Dr Fimi said: "From editing The Silmarillion to the mammoth task of giving us The History Of Middle-earth series, he revealed his father's grand vision of a rich and complex mythology.

"He gave us a window into Tolkien's creative process, and he provided scholarly commentary that enriched our understanding of Middle-earth."

Charlie Redmayne, HarperCollins UK CEO, described him as a "devoted curator of his father's work" who spent decades "bringing Middle-earth to generations of readers".

The BBC's latest adaptation of Dracula became one of the highlights of the holiday season when it appeared on TV over the New Year.

The image of the bloodsucking Transylvanian aristocrat has become a cultural icon, inspiring everything from the nine Hammer horror movies to the Twilight series of young adult novels, and TV series ranging from Buffy the Vampire Slayer to Count Duckula.

Bram Stoker, whose gothic novel was published in 1897, was an Irishman and Dracula fans have long sought connections to the vampire in the author's homeland.

Image copyright BBC/Hartswood Films Image caption Danish actor Claes Bang plays Bram Stoker's Transylvanian vampire in the recent BBC adaptation

One possible connection is in St Patrick's Church of Ireland Church in Monaghan town.

Lucy Westenra - Dracula's beautiful teenage victim - is one of the central characters in the novel.

Westenra is certainly an unusual name. It's also the name of the local Ascendancy landowning family, also known as the Rossmores.

Image caption Did this dramatic tableau in a Monaghan church inspire the character of Lucy Westenra?

And in the church, there's a memorial sculpture portraying the deathbed of a young woman.

It's a dramatic scene, known as The Parting Glance, in which the woman's distraught husband has to be restrained by a friend.

The sculpture was dedicated to Mary Ann Westenra by her grieving husband, Lord Warner William Westenra.

Bram Stoker was an Inspector of Petty Sessions before he became a novelist and it is thought he would have visited Monaghan in the course of his work.

The theory goes that Stoker saw the sculpture and used the image of the young woman and the Westenra name to conjure up the character of Lucy.

"It's possibly as simple as he was on his lunch break and happened to walk into the church," said local historian, Sinead O'Reilly.

Image copyright Hulton Archive Image caption Bram Stoker, the Irish-born Dracula author, travelled the country as an inspector of petty sessions courts

The Dracula connection was great for Monaghan tourism, she added.

"I've been searching and searching but I've never been able to find a connection between Stoker and the Westenras," admitted Ms O'Reilly.

Monaghan-based actor Martin Markey recalled appearing in a local production of Dracula in the Westenra Arms Hotel in Monaghan in the 1980s.

"At one stage I was pointing at the church with a bat on my hand and little did I know," he said.

Mr Markey thinks there is potential to make more of the Dracula connection.

"I hope some day we can establish a Bram Stoker festival here in Monaghan," he said.

According to the Encyclopaedia Britannica, some people believe that babies born with teeth are predisposed to becoming vampires

Orava Castle in northern Slovakia, the location used for Castle Dracula in the recent BBC production, was also used in 1922 for the first successful vampire film, Nosferatu

Bram Stoker's great-uncle, George Blake, was executed for his part in the 1798 Rebellion against British rule. He is said to have requested that the executioner's rope be soaped to ensure a quick death

Bob Curran is a retired lecturer from Ulster University. He has a unique perspective on the Dracula story that combines the ancient and the contemporary.

"Dracula is Irish," he said , with not a trace of doubt in his voice.

He should know, having written books such as Vampires: A Field Guide to the Creatures That Stalk the Night, the Werewolf Handbook and the Truth about the Leprechaun.

Image caption Bob Curran says Dracula was based on a blood-drinking chieftain from County Derry

According to Mr Curran, Stoker had an interest in Irish folklore and the character of Dracula was based on a Celtic chieftain called Abhartach, who is buried in the townland of Slaughtaverty between Garvagh and Dungiven in County Londonderry.

The story goes that Abhartach was a tyrant, who terrorised the local peasantry. Attempts to kill him failed and he kept reappearing demanding a bowl of blood each time.

Image caption The alleged grave of Abhartach, the Irish vampire said to have been run through with a sword made of yew wood

He was one of "the night walking dead," Mr Curran explained. In the end, the tyrant was run through with a sword of yew wood and buried upside down, which seemed to put an end to his after-life appearances.

The legend was, according to Mr Curran, well-known in Irish literary circles.

"Lady Wilde, Oscar Wilde's mother, certainly knew about it and Stoker was a regular visitor to the Wilde's house in Dublin," he said.

The academic's other theory is that Dracula is a social commentary on conditions in Ireland in the late 19th century. Dracula is a wealthy landlord, whose power is resented by the local peasantry.

"All the elements of Ireland are there and you're not looking at a horror novel but at a novel of contemporary issues and about contemporary Ireland," he explained.

Dracula is available on BBC iPlayer until the end of January 2020. Catch up here.

   Brexit: There will be no automatic deportation for EU citizens

EU citizens will not automatically be deported if they fail to sign up to the settled status scheme by the 2021 deadline, Downing Street has said.

The confirmation comes after European Parliament Brexit co-ordinator Guy Verhofstadt said he had been given the assurance by the UK government.

Under the settlement scheme, EU citizens living in the UK can apply to stay in the country after Brexit.

So far the number of applicants to the scheme has hit more than 2.7 million.

Nearly 2.5 million EU citizens have been told they can live and work in the UK after Brexit, while six "serious or persistent" criminals have had their applications rejected.

The deadline for applying to the scheme is 30 June 2021.

Mr Verhofstadt told BBC Radio 4's Today programme he believed those who missed the deadline would still be able to apply for settled status after "giving grounds why it was not possible to do it within the normal procedures".

"There will be no automatic deportation," he added.

In October last year, Home Office minister Brandon Lewis told German newspaper Die Welt: "If EU citizens until this point of time have not registered and have no adequate reason for it, then the valid immigration rules will be applied."

When pressed on whether that would include those who met the legal requirements for residence but did not apply by the deadline, he replied: "Theoretically yes. We will apply the rules."

But on Friday Mr Lewis said deporting EU citizens who have not applied for settled status "is not what we're about".

In an interview for the BBC's Politics East programme, to be shown on Sunday, he said his focus was on encouraging people to apply now.

Mr Lewis added: "At the end of June 2021, if people haven't applied and they've got good reason for that, we'll be looking at that and we'll be looking to grant status.

"But I don't want to get to that place. I want people to apply now."

When asked if police could be knocking on people's in June next year and escorting them out of the country if they have not applied, he said: "That is not what we're about, we're saying to people who have made their home here, 'we value you we want you to stay.'"

Image copyright EPA Image caption Guy Verhofstadt is the European Parliament's Brexit co-ordinator and a former prime minister of Belgium

Mr Verhofstadt told Today he had been told that the UK government was looking at the possibility of EU citizens being able to print out documentary proof of their status.

Responding to his comments, the Home Office said: "There is no change to our digital approach. It has always been the case that people could print a copy of their confirmation letter, but this can't be used as evidence of status."

It added: "The EU settlement scheme grants people with a secure, digital status which future-proofs their rights. Physical documents can get lost, stolen, damaged and tampered with."

Mr Verhofstadt also said the possibility had been raised of EU citizens sitting on the independent monitoring authority that will be in place to oversee citizens' rights.

Asked whether he thought the UK could ever rejoin the EU in the future, Mr Verhofstadt said he thought it would eventually happen but "difficult to say when".

"There will be a young generation who will say, 'What have we done? We want to go back,'" he added.

Conservative MEP Daniel Hannan praised the UK government's handling of the issue of citizens' rights, saying: "A system is now up and running, and it is by far the most effective and the most generous in any of the EU countries.

"I don't think you will find a single state among the [other] 27 [EU states] that has a system in place to grant rights to established UK nationals that is working as generously and without any cost to the people concerned, as ours is in return."

Maps identifying the breeding hotspots of some of the most threatened seabirds have been published for the first time.

Scientists at RSPB Scotland tracked the life of kittiwakes, guillemots, razorbills and shags as they forage at sea during the breeding season.

This has revealed huge swathes of Scotland's coastline are vital for the four seabird species.

The birds have all been classed as "birds of conservation concern" due to falling populations.

RSPB Scotland tracked the movements of kittiwakes, guillemots, razorbills and shags for five years.

The conservation charity then paid for this data to be applied to maps to identify the most important areas used during breeding season.

It is hoped the maps can be used to inform decisions being made about fishing rights and new offshore wind farm developments.

Image copyright RSPB Scotland Image caption An RSPB map showing the breeding hotspots, using four different methodologies, for the kittiwake around the UK

Dr Ian Cleasby, lead author of the research, published in the journal Biological Conservation, said the hotspots cover areas larger than the existing Special Protection Areas for birds.

He said: "The results from this research provides better evidence that allows us to identify important areas of sea that should be part of protected areas and help to improve how we plan for development at sea to reduce conflicts between the needs of our seabirds and human activities at sea."

The mapping reveals that the Scottish coastline, particularly the east coast, is important for kittiwakes, guillemots and razorbills. For shags, hotspots were smaller than observed in the other three species and were typically found in inshore coastal waters.

Charles Nathan, head of planning and development at RSPB Scotland, said: "This research can help to direct development to areas where the risks to nature are lowest and focus conservation efforts to where they can best boost the recovery and resilience of our seabirds."

A total of four different hotspot mapping techniques, shaped by species ecology and conservation goals. were applied to the breeding data for each of the four seabirds and they identify similar key sites, but vary in total area covered.

Three brothers from Scotland have set three world records after rowing the Atlantic Ocean in just 35 days.

Jamie, Ewan and Lachlan MacLean are the first three brothers to row any ocean, and the youngest trio and the fastest trio to ever row the Atlantic.

They set off from La Gomera, in the Canary Islands on 12 December and have now completed the 3,000-mile trip to Antigua.

Previously, the fastest a trio had ever rowed the Atlantic Ocean was 41 days.

The MacLean brothers, known as Broar, overcame seasickness, battery issues, storms, dehydration and exhaustion to reach Antigua in record time.

Image copyright Atlantic Campaigns Image caption Lachlan, Jamie and Ewan MacLean have become the first three brothers to row any ocean, and the youngest trio to ever row the Atlantic

Originally from Edinburgh, the brothers finished third overall (first among trios) in the Talisker Whisky Atlantic Challenge, beating many teams of four and five.

They had to row the last 20 days without any music, podcasts or audiobooks, as their iPhone cables succumbed to damage caused by a combination of sun and seawater. However, being musicians, they kept themselves entertained with a bagpipe, harmonica and ukelele on board.

Jamie and Lachlan, students at the Glasgow University and Glasgow School of Art respectively, convinced their brother Ewan, a design engineer for Dyson in Bristol, to take a sabbatical from work to make this world record attempt.

The 27-year-old said: "They had to twist my arm but I will be forever grateful to my brothers for convincing me to do this.

"This was, without doubt, the defining experience of my life. It was incredibly difficult but the way we came together, the way our bodies and minds coped with every single challenge, will stay with me for a long time.

"It definitely tested our relationship, but it was remarkable how we were able to lift each other up as we struggled. It's brought us closer together, although I am looking forward to getting to see and talk to some different people."

The MacLean brothers developed a love for the outdoors during summers spent in Nedd in Sutherland. Once they come home to Scotland, they plan to head back to Nedd to plan their next adventure.

They completed the challenge in 35 days nine hours and nine minutes.

They are hoping to raise £250,000 for Feedback Madagascar and Children First.

Extinction Rebellion protesters have ended a blockade at the entrances to Shell's Aberdeen headquarters.

Activists arrived at the Altens base at about 06:30 and remained at the site until 19:30 in a bid to "hold Shell to account".

The group said the protest was part of its two-week long campaign targeting the fossil fuel industry.

Shell said it was addressing its emissions and helping customers to reduce theirs.

And industry body Oil and Gas UK (OGUK) said climate change would not be solved by "stunts".

Extinction Rebellion also had its purple boat at the site.

The protesters were also in Aberdeen city centre on Thursday afternoon, including at the Union Square shopping centre.

A statement from Extinction Rebellion Scotland said: "Today's successful protest marked the final day of 10 days of action focused on the fossil fuel industry, and in particular Shell's role in driving the climate crisis.

"Thirty activists spent 13 hours blockading the entrances to Shell HQ all day, sending a message that we won't take their wilful avoidance in the face of the climate emergency any more."

The group vowed to continue taking action until governments and industry respond "sensibly and appropriately" to the warnings from scientists and public figures, such as broadcaster Sir David Attenborough.

It concluded: "Anything other than a rapid winding down of the fossil fuel industry is irresponsible and reckless."

One of the protesters, Michael, a 57-year-old management consultant, said: "Governments and corporations like Shell all agree that my children are facing a catastrophic climate and ecological collapse yet are doing next to nothing to prevent this.

"I'm here today because as a parent I am ultimately responsible for the safety of my children whether today, tomorrow or in 30 years time."

Image copyright Extinction Rebellion Scotland Image caption The protest began early on Thursday

A Shell spokesman said: "The heightened awareness of climate change that we have seen over recent months is a good thing.

"As a company, we agree that urgent action is needed. What will really accelerate change is effective policy, investment in technology innovation and deployment, and changing customer behaviour.

"As we move to a lower-carbon future, we are committed to playing our part, by addressing our own emissions and helping customers to reduce theirs - because we all have a role to play."

'Taking action'

OGUK communications director Gareth Wynn said: "Climate change will be solved by practical actions not conspiracy theories and stunts.

"It's disappointing that this group is choosing to disrupt the normal working day of people in this industry, causing alarm rather than engage in meaningful discussion with key decision makers.

"Our industry is packed full of people with the engineering and environmental knowledge and skills to play a key part in reducing emissions and we are already taking action."

Ch Insp Davie Howieson, local area commander for Aberdeen South, said: "Officers are currently in attendance at a peaceful protest in Wellington Road, Aberdeen, outside the Shell premises.

"The road was blocked from around 06:45, and road users are advised to avoid the area for the time being. We are liaising with both Shell and the protest organisers, Extinction Rebellion."

   A man forced to quit work because of Lyme disease hopes pop star Justin Bieber's admission he has it will raise awareness of the condition.

Mark Morgan, from Cardiff, said the illness is so debilitating he can no longer work because of the "constant symptoms of anxiety and fatigue".

There are about 3,000 cases of the disease - a bacterial infection spread by ticks - each year in the UK.

Ex-engineer Mr Morgan said people do not understand its long-lasting impact.

He has been experiencing symptoms that could be attributed to Lyme disease since puberty.

The 54-year-old said it became "increasingly difficult" to hold down a job as he got older because of the long term effects of the disease and in 2015 he had to stop working completely.

It got to the point Mr Morgan was sleeping in his car on his lunch break so he could finish his day at work.

He said people often do not understand that his symptoms of fatigue and anxiety are severe.

"People often remark that I look OK, but I don't feel OK," Mr Morgan said.

He said he was "quite pleased" to get the diagnosis after his illness was dismissed by doctors, but he did not realise how difficult the condition was to treat.

"People need to understand that it is a serious, potentially long-term condition. The symptoms are dreadful," he said.

"People need take precautions to avoid being bitten by ticks and, if bitten, seek immediate medical treatment."

Earlier this month, pop star Justin Bieber announced he had been living with Lyme Disease for what he described as a "rough couple of years".

The Canadian took to Instagram to share that he was suffering from the chronic infection after speculation he had a drug problem.

Bieber told his 124 million Instagram followers the disease had affected his "skin, brain function, energy, and overall health".

Singer Avril Lavigne and supermodel Bella Hadid have previously revealed that they also suffer from Lyme disease.

Skip Twitter post by @haileybieber For those who are trying to downplay the severity of Lyme disease. Please do your research and listen to the stories of people who have suffered with it for years. Making fun of and belittling a disease you don’t understand is never the way, all it takes is educating yourself. — Hailey Bieber (@haileybieber) January 8, 2020 Report

Bieber's supermodel wife, Hailey Bieber, defended her husband on Twitter against criticism from those "trying to downplay the severity of Lyme disease".

"Please do your research," she urged them.

A spokeswoman for charity Caudwell LymeCo said the news about Bieber shows the disease "really can affect anyone" and hoped his announcement would "reach a new audience who might be suffering similar symptoms without knowing the root cause".

What is Lyme disease?

A bacterial infection carried by some species of ticks and about 13% in the UK are believed to be infected

It cannot be passed on from person to person

Symptoms - including the bulls-eye rash, fatigue and fever - usually develop around three weeks after a bite

The majority of those who take the full three-week course of antibiotics make a full recovery

Lyme Disease UK said if the condition is diagnosed early it can usually be treated with antibiotics, which are key to helping reduce acute cases.

A spokeswoman said: "When celebrities use their platform to raise awareness it's a reminder that the illness doesn't discriminate.

"Even high profile sufferers can have a very hard time getting an accurate diagnosis and adequate treatment."

   Grieving Kenyan grandmother calls for better road safety
  </title>

   Kenya,World Health Organization (WHO)
  </tags>
  <text>
   Kenyan Mary Wambui is still traumatised by the deaths of her daughter and three-year-old grandson after they were hit by a vehicle in 2016.

They were trying to cross a busy six-lane highway close to Kenya's capital, Nairobi, when the accident happened.

Ms Wambui's daughter, Monicah Nyambura, died on the spot, but her grandchild, Brian, who was badly injured, spent much of the following year in hospital before he too died.

They were just two of the almost 3,000 people who were killed that year on Kenya's roads, where safety rules are often poorly observed.

Deaths and injuries from traffic accidents across the continent are considered to be a major health issue by the World Health Organization (WHO).

Dedicated grandson

"I miss them all. I miss them," she told the BBC as she sat by Brian's grave.

"He was the grandchild who would stay with me when the rest would leave the house in the morning," she said.

The wooden cross on the grave was broken, but the grieving grandmother said she would let it stay that way.

There was nothing that could assuage her pain.

BBC I didn't even cry, I couldn't. I didn't even have tears."

"I didn't even cry," she said, thinking back to 2016.

"I couldn't. I don't know what to tell you. I didn't even have tears."

The elderly woman said she spent most of the time after the accident by Brian's bedside in hospital.

She finally cried when he died. There was a terrible pain in her stomach that would not go away, she said.

Her daughter, Ms Nyambura, was killed while crossing the busy highway rather than using a footbridge, as the nearest one was too far away for her.

Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Some pedestrians complain there are not enough footbridges on the major highways in the Kenyan capital

In response to her death, her mother has asked the authorities to build more footbridges on the roads, so other fatalities can be avoided.

Currently, pedestrians make up the largest number of people killed on Kenya's roads, accounting for nearly 40% of the 3,572 road deaths last year, according to the National Transport and Safety Authority (NTSA).

'Ignorance and impunity'

"You find people being hit right below a footbridge," ex-NTSA chief Francis Meja told the BBC.

"You ask yourself, really, are people not sensitive to this fact? From where we sit, we think this is out of ignorance or impunity."

For pedestrians, however, convenience sometimes comes first.

It is not uncommon to find people crossing the wide lanes of Thika highway, the road that claimed Ms Wambui's daughter and grandson, as well as other major routes in and around Nairobi.

In some places, there is barbed wire on the barriers to deter people from taking the risk, but it is not always effective.

Across University Way, a major route out of the centre of Nairobi, groups of people are constantly hurrying across the six-lane highway, almost oblivious to the lurking danger of the vehicles that speed by.

Image caption Pedestrians will take the risk of crossing a six-lane main road rather than use the footbridge nearby

Crossing the road at this point is the fastest way across, Tiffany Njeri told the BBC.

Her friend Anne Katsutsu agrees, saying they did not notice the footbridge that they are meant to use.

But the safe crossing is not so far away.

Another pedestrian, Ramadhan Abdallah, said it was a matter of laziness, plus a lack of enforcement of the rules, which meant that people do whatever is convenient for them as long as no-one from the authorities is watching

'Safety in numbers'

"I was just calculating... to walk from here to the footbridge [is too far]... and I can just cross here," he said.

"I'm not worried about safety… since there are many of us, there is that psyche [that we're safe] and so I just cross."

The high number of pedestrian deaths is similar across sub-Saharan Africa, according to the WHO.

Overall, the region has the highest number of deaths on the road as a proportion of the population, WHO figures show.

This is despite sub-Saharan Africa having the lowest number of motor vehicles.

Road traffic deaths per 100,000 (2016) 93% of world's road fatalities occur in low and middle-income countries, WHO says

Suggesting one reason why there are more road deaths in Africa than elsewhere, the WHO said in a 2018 report that there was a significant link between a country's income level and the level of traffic fatalities.

It suggested that adequate road safety rules and speed limits were not enforced or observed in many poorer countries. It also said that a lack of child seat belts and drunk driving contribute to the high death toll.

Rules ignored

"Whereas 60% of countries with laws meeting best practice are from the European region, only 2% are from the African region," the WHO report said.

It added that in many countries, vulnerable road users, such as pedestrians, are largely ignored in the planning, design and operation of roads.

Travelling around Nairobi, it is clear that makeshift markets and hawking can block people on foot and encroach on the highway, forcing people to walk on the road.

Image caption Pedestrians often have to walk on the roads as traders take up the pavement

Mr Meja said the WHO recommends that 10% of total road construction costs are spent on safety initiatives - but in Kenya the figure is less than 1%.

He told the BBC there is more the government can do to protect the vulnerable and create awareness.

But a recent study by the Overseas Development Institute said that persuading people to behave more safely would not solve the problem as the underlying causes of incidents, such as road design and better urban planning, need to be addressed.

In the meantime pedestrians, like Ms Wambui's daughter and grandson, will continue to pay a heavy price because road designs prioritise cars and other motorised transport.

The deaths of more than a million people in Nigeria as a result of the brutal civil war which ended exactly 50 years ago are a scar on the nation's history.

For most Nigerians, the war over the breakaway state of Biafra is generally regarded as an unfortunate episode best forgotten, but for the Igbo people who fought for secession, it remains a life-defining event.

In 1967, following two coups and turmoil which led to about a million Igbos returning to the south-east of Nigeria, the Republic of Biafra seceded with 33-year-old military officer Emeka Odumegwu Ojukwu at the helm.

The Nigerian government declared war and after 30 months of fighting, Biafra surrendered. On 15 January 1970, the conflict officially ended.

The government's policy of "no victor, no vanquished" may have led to a lack of official reflection, but many Nigerians of Igbo origin grew up on stories from people who lived through the war.

Three of those who were involved in the secessionist campaign have been sharing their memories.

'We thought we were magicians'

Christopher Ejike Ago, soldier

He had just finished grammar school and started training as a veterinary assistant at the University of Nigeria, Nsukka (UNN), in south-eastern Nigeria, when the civil war began.

Almost every student he knew became part of the war effort.

He joined the Biafran army and was assigned to the signal unit, whose responsibilities included "active intelligence and eavesdropping on the Nigerian military".

Christopher Ejike Ago The Nigerians who were pursuing us were trained soldiers... We were drafted into the war, given two days' training."

"We thought we were magicians," said 76-year-old Mr Ago.

"The Nigerians who were pursuing us were trained soldiers. We were not. We were drafted into the war, given two days' training.

"Plus the fact that we were hungry. Some of us, our skin was getting rotten. Nobody can fight a war like that."

In January 1966, some senior Nigerian army officers, mostly of the Igbo ethnic group, assassinated key politicians during a coup in the West African state.

Those killed included Ahmadu Bello, a revered leader in the north.

This led to months of massacres against the Igbo living in the north. Tens of thousands were killed while about a million fled to what was then known as the Eastern Region.

Image copyright Mirrorpix Image caption Emeka Odumegwu Ojukwu, pictured here in June 1968, was a charismatic figure

These events sparked the decision to secede, spearheaded by Ojukwu, who was then the military governor of the Eastern Region.

In the months preceding the war, Ojukwu often visited UNN, the only university in south-eastern Nigeria at the time, to meet with students and prepare them for secession.

Mr Ago looked forward to these visits, and joined the crowd who gathered at the university's Freedom Square.

"Once his helicopter touched down, everybody went there and, practically, school shut down.

"He had this incredible sense of humour. He spiked everybody up and we formed songs and were singing and enjoying ourselves."

In the first year of the war, the Nigerian government captured the coastal city of Port Harcourt and imposed a blockade, which cut food supplies to Biafra.

Mr Ago remembers the overpowering hunger that often forced Biafran soldiers to catch and eat mice. He also remembers the last year of the war when his unit was continuously on the move, fleeing the advancing Nigerian army.

"Somewhere in the middle of the war," he said, "the Biafrans made some dramatic successes that gave us hope that we might hold the Nigerians until at least some help from outside came."

By late 1969, all hope was lost.

Biafra timeline

January 1966 - Nigerian government overthrown in what was seen as an "Igbo coup" led by junior army officers

January 1966 - Lt Col Odumegwu-Ojukwu appointed military governor of Eastern Region

July 1966 - Second coup masterminded by Murtala Muhammed, Lt Col Yakubu Gowon becomes head of state

June to October 1966 - Riots in northern Nigeria targeted at Igbos, killing many and forcing up to a million to return to south-eastern Nigeria

May 1967 - Ojukwu declares independence of the Republic of Biafra

July 1967 - War begins

October 1967 - Biafran capital Enugu falls

May 1968 - Nigeria captures oil-rich Port Harcourt

April 1969 - Umuahia, new Biafran capital falls to Nigerian forces

January 1970 - Ojukwu flees Nigeria

January 1970 - Biafra surrenders

Mr Ago left the army and went in search of his family, whom he had not heard from in more than two years.

He collected his portion from an allocation of raw rice to his unit, then set off towards the village of a relative, where he suspected his parents and siblings would be holed up.

"I had to carry the rice while starving myself, carrying it across rivers and forests until I found them," he said.

Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Hunger caused the deaths of many people during the conflict

Many of his friends and classmates had died at the battlefront. But his family was delighted to see that the son and brother they assumed dead was alive. And they were glad that he had turned up with food.

Hunger killed more Biafrans than bullets and bombs.

When the university was reopened a few months after the war ended, Mr Ago returned to UNN, eventually graduating with a degree in plant and soil science.

"I think we would have done better if we had handled it with a little bit more intelligence," said Mr Ago. "I think now that Ojukwu… thought he was Jesus Christ.

"He thought he could do magic. If he had slowed down and allowed some people who were with him to advise him properly, we would have come out better than we did."

'They only had knives and cutlasses'

Felix Nwankwo Oragwu, scientist

He was a physics lecturer at UNN when the civil war began.

For the next 30 months, he headed the Research and Production (RAP) group comprising Igbo scientists from various fields.

Its primary responsibility was to provide technological support to the Biafran army, which was poorly equipped.

Felix Nwankwo Oragwu When the war started, there was not a single weapon... anywhere throughout Biafra. No gun, no bomb, no nothing."

The RAP's most notable product was the "ogbunigwe", a weapons launcher of remarkable and devastating effect which influenced the outcome of many battles in Biafra's favour, according to historical reports.

"Without us, the war would have lasted only about 30 hours," said the 85-year-old.

"When the war started, there was not a single weapon either in a store or anywhere throughout Biafra. They only had knives and cutlasses. No gun, no bomb, no nothing."

In the aftermath of the war, the Nigerian government did not want to impose any form of collective punishment.

Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Felix Nwankwo Oragwu and others helped develop some of the weapons that Biafran soldiers used

Nevertheless, the Igbo faced some devastating consequences, particularly economically as the Biafran currency that people had accumulated became worthless.

Many Igbo still feel sidelined in Nigerian politics, as since the civil war no-one from the ethnic group has become president.

Increasing cries of marginalisation have led in recent years to the emergence of Igbo groups agitating once again for secession, particularly the Indigenous People of Biafra (Ipob), formed by UK-based British-Nigerian Nnamdi Kanu.

Mr Oragwu wishes that the Igbo had paid less attention to the scramble for power at the centre, and instead distinguished their region by advancing the technological gains of the war.

"Biafra would have been a technological nation and would have been able to compete with anybody," he said, anger in his voice.

"That is what makes me sad. By this time, we would have been competing with at least South Korea."

The scientist's wartime accomplishments had caught the attention of the Nigerian authorities and he was invited by the government to pioneer a special science and technology programme for the country.

He was behind the setting up of four universities of science and technology in different regions of Nigeria and after retirement he published Scientific and Technological Innovations in Biafra, a book he hoped would inspire young Nigerians.

"Nigeria was programmed by the British colonial authorities not to participate in production and manufacture of global technologies," he wrote in the book.

"The war gave the opportunity to… reject the colonial design."

'An incredible period'

Edna Nwanunobi, teacher

She was teaching English and French in a secondary school in Port Harcourt in southern Nigeria when the civil war began.

While the UK backed Nigeria, France was the most prominent supporter of Biafra.

But English was more widely spoken in Biafra, so translators were needed whenever French officials visited Ojukwu.

Edna Nwanunobi "You were forced to fraternise with your people more than any time before"

Ms Nwanunobi joined the Biafran ministry of foreign affairs as part of a handful of translators who worked directly with Ojukwu.

"The war was an incredible period," said 82-year-old Mrs Nwanunobi. "Everybody was forced to go home so you were forced to fraternise with your people more than any time before.

"And people who worked in every Biafra office were high level people. These were people who were doing all sorts of things and the war forced them out of their positions."

She enjoyed working directly with the Biafran leader, whom she and her colleagues fondly referred to as "Brother OJ".

"He was a gorgeous person," she said again and again. "And he was disciplined. If any meeting lasted more than two hours, he wouldn't be party to it."

Her most memorable assignment occurred after the Biafran military captured six Italian oil workers employed by the Nigerian government.

Officials from different European countries travelled to meet Ojukwu to appeal for their release.

"That was the largest assembly we had," she recalled. "Even the Vatican sent representatives."

During the meeting, Mrs Nwanunobi conveyed to Ojukwu that he stood the risk of losing European support.

He promised to consider the matter, and the Italians were subsequently released.

Image copyright Getty Images Image caption The plight of Biafrans gained support among activists around the world, including in London, where this protest was held in 1968

Mrs Nwanunobi met Ojukwu for the last time on 23 December 1969, when she lined up outside his office with her colleagues, to receive a Christmas gift and a handshake from him.

A few days later, she left the country for the Biafran office in Paris. During a stopover of several days in Lisbon, she heard that Biafra had surrendered.

Her first concern was for Ojukwu.

"I was worried that he would come to harm," she said softly. "I didn't want anybody to disgrace him."

Her worry lifted when she learned that her boss had escaped in his private jet, and was granted asylum by Ivory Coast, a francophone country.

Mrs Nwanunobi spent much of the 1970s in Canada before returning to Nigeria in 1977, where she resumed work as a secondary school teacher.

Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Ojukwu was given a full Nigerian military burial in March 2012

Ojukwu himself remained in exile for 13 years. After he was officially pardoned by the Nigerian government, he returned in 1982, with multitudes pouring onto the streets of his home state of Anambra to welcome him.

He died in November 2011 and was given a full military burial in a ceremony attended by then Nigerian President Goodluck Jonathan, some other African leaders and members of the diplomatic corps.

Fifty years after the Biafran conflict, Nigeria is still battling to maintain its unity, with various groups, not just the Igbo, calling for the restructuring of Africa's most populous state.

It is probably for this reason that the war is barely mentioned.

The government has nothing to gain by reminding Nigerians that secession happened before and can be attempted again.

On the 50th anniversary since the end of the Biafran war, Miracle talks to her grandmother about her memories of living through the conflict.

The Biafran war took place between 1967 and 1970 in Nigeria over the formation of the state of Biafra.

It was one of Africa's bloodiest post-independence conflicts during which over a million people died through famine, disease and fighting.

   Fake drugs: How bad is Africa’s counterfeit medicine problem?

The proliferation of fake medicines in Africa is a public health crisis that can no longer be ignored, according to a UK charity.

There's a meeting of seven African countries, in Togo, this week, to combat the problem.

Congo, Niger, Senegal, Togo, Uganda, Ghana and The Gambia will discuss measures to clamp down on trafficking in fake medicines, says the Brazzaville Foundation.

But how big a problem is counterfeit medicine in Africa, and what impact does it have?

How many counterfeit drugs are there?

Globally, the trade in counterfeit pharmaceuticals is worth up to $200bn (£150bn) annually, with Africa among the regions most affected, according to industry estimates.

The World Health Organization (WHO) says 42% of all fake medicines reported to them between 2013 and 2017 were from Africa.

The European region and the Americas (North and South) accounted for 21% each.

But how reliable are these figures?

The WHO has a reporting mechanism that relies on national or regional regulatory authorities around the world to notify it of seizures. So the data for 2013-17 is only as good as the surveillance and reporting systems in the countries or regions concerned.

Fake medicine seizures 2013-17 % reported

The WHO has itself noted that as more officers were trained and national regulators became more aware, the numbers of drug seizure reports went up. So it's possible areas with weak regulation and enforcement may be under-reporting the extent of the problem.

Bright Simons, who set up a mobile system to verify drugs in Ghana, says it's not possible to produce a precise estimate, as the trade is underground.

But there've been several seizures in recent years, which give an indication of the size of the problem in West Africa:

Ivory Coast, Guinea-Bissau, Liberia and Sierra Leone seized 19 tonnes of counterfeit medicines in 2018

Smugglers in Ivory Coast were intercepted trying to bring in 12 tonnes of counterfeit pharmaceuticals from Ghana in 2019

An Interpol-led operation in seven West African countries seized more than 420 tonnes of illicit pharmaceutical products in 2017

Nearly 19.88 tonnes of fake medicines were seized in Mali between 2015-18

The accounting firm PwC says the proportion of fake pharmaceuticals in some countries can be as high as 70%, in developing regions such as Africa.

The WHO estimates one out of every 10 medical products in low- and middle-income countries, which includes most of Africa, is sub-standard or fake.

What harm do fake drugs do?

Analysis by the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine for the WHO estimates substandard and fake anti-malarial drugs could be causing 116,000 extra deaths from the disease every year in sub-Saharan Africa at a cost to patients and health systems of on average $38.5m a year.

And in 2015, a study published in the American Society of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene estimated more than 122,000 children under the age of five died each year because of sub-standard anti-malarial drugs in sub-Saharan Africa.

Although these results are only estimates, the scientists say they suggest poor quality drugs are important contributors to under-five mortality rates.

Why is it hard to fight fake medicines?

Fake medicine can often be indistinguishable from the real products, with the packaging as good if not better than the original.

And weak or inconsistent legal frameworks and the lack of regulations to address sales, often carried out online or in informal locations, add to the problem, the UN says.

Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Drugs for sale at a roadside market in Lagos, Nigeria

There's also an issue with the cost of drugs in poorer countries.

"If a good quality medicine from a known supplier is too expensive, people may try a cheaper one from an unlicensed supplier," the WHO says.

Cutting prices for licensed drugs, however, does not guarantee a solution.

Even low priced medicines can make money for criminals, as long as the sales volume is high enough.

But there are some technological solutions being tried out to tackle the problem, including mobile apps to help users verify medicines, using scratch stickers, barcodes and other means of identification printed on packaging.

   Cheetah smuggling out of Ethiopia 'fuelled by exotic pets demand'

   Image copyright AFP Image caption Cheetahs are trafficked from the Horn of Africa to the Gulf states

A growing demand for exotic pets in Saudi Arabia and the UAE is fuelling the smuggling of cheetahs in Ethiopia, a top Ethiopian wildlife official has told the BBC.

Every month, at least four cheetahs were smuggled to the Gulf nations, Daniel Pawlos said.

Smugglers sell the animals for more than $10,000 (£7,600) to wealthy families.

Only 7,100 cheetahs are left in the wild, at least 90% of them in Africa.

Cheetahs are an endangered species, according to the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (Cites).

Ethiopians were being financially lured into capturing and selling cheetah cubs, said Mr Pawlos, who is the director of Ethiopian Wildlife Development and Protection Authority.

They are paid between 10,000 to 15,000 Ethiopian birr ($310-466; £230-355) for each cub.

Smugglers then moved the animals to Hargeisa, the capital of self-declared independent Somaliland, and then trafficked to oil-rich Saudia Arabia and the UAE through Yemen, Mr Pawlos said.

He added that the cubs were sold on the black market for more than $10,000 to rich people who wanted to keep them as exotic pets and as a status symbol.

On Thursday, security forces in Saudi Arabia were reported to have arrested people accused of trying to smuggle cheetahs into the country.

They say they noticed movements in bags that a group were carrying on their backs. The bags were opened and the cheetahs discovered, Al-Madina news agency reported.

A video uploaded online by Al-Madina shows what purports to be three of the cheetahs.

Conservationists say many cheetahs die en route to the Gulf states, and that the illegal trade is threatening to wipe out their populations in countries like Somalia and Ethiopia.

   Angola's Isabel dos Santos: Africa's richest woman eyes presidency

Angolan billionaire Isabel dos Santos, who is embroiled in a huge financial scandal, has suggested that she may seek to become the country's president.

In a BBC interview, Ms Dos Santos pointedly declined four times to rule out running for the presidency.

Her father José Eduardo dos Santos ruled Angola for 38 years. Prosecutors are seeking to recover $1bn (£760m) Ms Dos Santos and her associates are alleged to owe the state.

She has denied any wrongdoing.

Ms Dos Santos, 46, is one of the world's richest women, with Forbes magazine estimating her fortune to be worth $2.2bn, making her the richest woman in Africa.

Her father controversially appointed her as the head of Angola's state-owned oil firm Sonangol in 2016.

She was sacked from the post in 2017 by President Joao Lourenço, her father's handpicked successor.

What did she say?

In an interview in London, she repeatedly stressed that her life was at risk if she returned to Angola in the current circumstances.

Refusing to rule out the possibility of running for president, she said she had a strong sense of patriotism and duty to her country.

"To lead is to serve, so I will do whatever my life takes me," she said.

Ms Dos Santos later told a Portuguese television channel that "it's possible" she might run for the presidency in 2022.

The announcement marks a dramatic shift for a woman who has consistently portrayed herself as an entrepreneur with no interest in politics.

A court in the Angolan capital, Luanda, last month ordered the freezing of her bank accounts and of her vast business empire in the oil-rich country, following a string of investigations into alleged corruption by the Dos Santos family which prosecutors say has robbed the state of more than $2bn.

"These are false allegations and this is part of… an orchestrated attack by the current government that is completely politically motivated," she said.

Her half-brother, José Filomeno dos Santos, is on trial in Angola on charges of corruption.

The prosecution alleges that he and his co-accused helped spirit $500m out of the country during his time as head of Angola's Sovereign Wealth Fund. They have pleaded not guilty.

What has changed in Angola?

Ms Dos Santos repeatedly lashed out at President Lourenço, who succeeded her father two years ago as president.

Despite coming from the same party, the MPLA, he has since stunned many Angolans by appearing to target the Dos Santos family as part of a broader anti-corruption drive.

"President Lourenço is fighting for absolute power. There's a strong wish to neutralise any influence that [former] President Dos Santos might still have in the MPLA," Ms Dos Santos said.

"If a different candidate would appear [ahead of the 2022 presidential election] supported by former President Dos Santos or allies linked to him, that would really challenge [Mr Lourenço's] position because his current track record is very, very poor," she added, citing rising unemployment, a stagnant economy and a wave of strikes.

But the allegations of corruption aimed at Ms Dos Santos and her half-brother have been given new weight by the criminal investigations launched against her in Angola.

"The reality is that there is more than enough evidence against her. She's a key figure in the Dos Santos family and a credible threat to Lourenço," said Darias Jonker, a regional analyst for the Eurasia Group, who said that legitimate allegations of corruption were being wielded by the state as part of a vicious power struggle within the MPLA.

"Lourenço is sending a signal that there's a new sheriff in town, with new rules," Mr Jonker added.

"He needs his own patronage network, but his model is much more modest - he won't allow the multi-billion-dollar patronage deals that were a hallmark of the Dos Santos era. Would Isabel support some sort of palace coup? I think it's something she'd certainly consider."

Image caption José Filomeno dos Santos is on trial for corruption

Ms Dos Santos insisted she was being used as a "scapegoat" by President Lourenço, and lashed out at the justice system in Angola, accusing the attorney general of "lying" and of refusing to allow her lawyers to see the evidence against her.

"I regret that Angola has chosen this path. I think that we all stand to lose a lot. A good leader is a prudent leader," she said, calling for a negotiated political solution to end her current legal battles and any further damage to the Angolan economy.

Could she actually win an election?

But could she, or perhaps a proxy or ally, oust the current president and pave the way for a triumphant homecoming?

"I am a businesswoman. A lot of people… do like me and do understand what I do and do believe in what I do.

"There are thousands of people whom we gave their first job," she said, highlighting her business credentials, and rejecting the widespread perception that she owes much of her fortune to her father's long presidency as "voices that come from the political opposition".

Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Angola's economy has boomed because of oil

But some observers have been quick to play down the idea of a Dos Santos dynasty with Isabel - derided, for years, as "The Princess" in Angola - filling her father's shoes.

"Isabel doesn't have a strong constituency in her favour inside the party. For now, the party is behind Lourenço, at least when it comes to the targeting of Isabel," said Ricardo Soares de Oliveira, an Oxford professor and expert on African politics.

"If he turns what is still a focused vendetta against the Dos Santos family into a systemic clean-up, the MPLA would not accept it and might even rediscover Dos Santos as the guy who enabled all of them to get rich. But there is no sign of this," the Oxford professor added.

"Dos Santos and Isabel remain deeply unpopular in the country and the party alike. I am not writing her off entirely but she is genuinely weakened by these ongoing revelations and her international standing is deteriorating fast."

With much of her fortune still thought to be intact outside Angola, Ms Dos Santos remains a formidable force.

If she were to seek the presidency - and in the interview, she stressed that her commercial battles were not necessarily best resolved by political manoeuvres - she would first need the law to change in Angola as she is currently ineligible to stand because her mother is Russian.

But those who have watched her remarkable business career, and her furious public assault on Angola's current political elites, agree that such an obstacle is unlikely to prove insurmountable.

Taal volcano in the Philippines started to erupt on Sunday. Rumbling sounds and tremors were followed by a huge plume of ash being released into the sky.

Towns around Taal - which is about 70km (45 miles) south of the capital Manila - were coated in thick ash and sludge, and in the early hours of Monday morning the volcano began to spew lava.

Taal is the Philippines' second most active volcano. It is also one of the world's smallest volcanoes, and has recorded at least 34 eruptions in the past 450 years.

Lightning was seen striking around the volcano's ash clouds as it erupted.

Since 2017, thousands of Kazakh Muslims have been detained in China’s infamous re-education camps. Survivors who have returned to Kazakhstan, say during months of incarceration they were tortured, beaten and received unknown injections.

Ethnic Kazakhs, as well as Uighurs and other Muslim minorities, have lived and moved freely across the Chinese-Kazakh border for centuries. However, as China’s clampdown on Islam continues, Beijing is now accused of locking up its Kazakh neighbours.

An Australian journalist living in Japan has been given a suspended sentence on charges of trespassing at the home of his estranged in-laws while searching for his children.

Scott McIntyre says he has not seen his children since May, when his relationship broke down.

He spent more than a month in jail before the case went to trial.

It is the latest case to highlight Japan's lack of joint custody laws, rare among developed countries.

What was the case about?

Mr McIntyre - a former football journalist for Australia's SBS network - was arrested in November, a month after allegedly entering the common area of the apartment building where his in-laws live.

He has apologised for his actions but said he just wanted to check his children were safe after Typhoon Hagibis hit Japan the month before.

Mr McIntyre has accused his wife of abducting their two children - now aged 11 and eight - in May and severing contact. His former partner has accused him of violence, which he denies.

He said he was kept in a cell with the lights on and was only allowed to bathe infrequently.

"This penalty should not be taken lightly," presiding judge Yuichi Tada said, handing down the six-month prison sentence, suspended for three years.

"However, the area [Mr McIntyre gained access to] was a common area and he did not use force. He has no criminal record and promised this court that he would not do it again."

Speaking outside court, Mr McIntyre said: "All I and other parents want is for Japan to join the civilised world and institute a system of joint custody."

"I am here on behalf of all those abducted children who don't have a voice. This is not a way for a modern society to operate. Children deserve two parents."

   Why are Chinese fishermen finding so many 'submarine spies'?

   Image caption A screengrab of a Chinese TV report on the drone findings

At first it seems like a quirky, what-are-the-chances-of-that headline: "China rewards fishers who netted foreign spy devices."

But behind that headline in Chinese state media, there is a different - and more intriguing - story.

Firstly, this wasn't two or three fishermen receiving awards. It was 11 - one woman, the rest men - who found seven devices in total.

Secondly, this wasn't the first time fishermen from Jiangsu had found "spy drones". In 2018, some 18 were rewarded for finding nine devices. There was also a ceremony a year earlier.

And thirdly, the rewards were huge - up to 500,000 yuan ($72,000; £55,000) - around 17 times the average disposable income in China.

So where do the "submarine spies" come from? What do they do? Why are they valuable?

And why are Chinese fishermen finding so many?

Image copyright Weibo Image caption The 11 award-winners in Jiangsu

Jiangsu is a province in eastern China, with a coastline more than 1,000km (620 miles) long.

It faces Japan and South Korea, while Taiwan is around 500 miles south. This geography - and the huge US presence in the region - begins to explain why fishermen keep finding these devices.

China has not revealed where the devices came from, merely saying they were "made in other countries".

But regional expert and consultant Alexander Neill says they probably came from "the US Navy, the Japan Self-Defense Forces, or potentially Taiwan - this is a big area of rivalry".

So what are the Americans, the Japanese, or the Taiwanese hoping to learn?

In 2009, the US Navy sponsored research into underwater drones, broadly known as "unmanned undersea vehicles (UUVs)". The research recommended seven ways UUVs could be used, including:

Tracking "potentially adversary submarines"

Looking for and dealing with underwater bombs - particularly in other countries' waters

Deploying surveillance equipment

Monitoring "undersea infrastructure", such as communication cables

The research also highlighted the strengths of UUVs. Gliders - a smaller UUV, likely to be what the Jiangsu fishermen found - can be deployed for "months" and are "cheap enough to be considered expendable".

In this instance, cheap means "only tens of thousands of dollars".

Their cost, range, and capability mean "submarine spies" are increasingly important - Mr Neill estimates the number worldwide is "certainly in the upper hundreds".

So this explains - in part - why they keep turning up in Chinese nets. The country has a huge fishing fleet, and the law of averages suggests it will scoop up the occasional drone.

But it's also true that China's fleet is different to other countries'. Some fishermen, themselves, are part of the military - and understanding how this unique unit works could explain why they keep finding military hardware.

The Chinese Maritime Militia is part of the national militia - that is, the reserve civilian forces.

It is "virtually unique and publicly obscure", according to Professor Andrew S. Erickson from the US Naval War College - but it is well-known to the United States military.

According to a 2017 report by the US Department of Defense, the CMM has played "significant roles in a number of military campaigns and coercive incidents over the years".

In the past, the CMM rented vessels from companies or fishermen. But now, the DoD says, "it appears China is building a state-owned fishing fleet for its militia force".

Indeed, Mr Neill says many boats are merely "masquerading as fishing vessels - they're actually doing naval and maritime surveillance against China's rivals".

"On paper they look like sophisticated, modern trawlers," he says. "But they are actually, essentially, military-type vessels - steel-hulled, not wooden-hulled, with increasing tonnage.

"If you look at photographs, it's clear they're networked in - because of their signalling capabilities - with the [regular navy] command and control network."

In effect, the fishing fleet can provide a low-level, first line of defence or surveillance - a military force working under a civilian cloak.

"A very significant swathe of China's fishing fleet is co-opted into the militia," says Mr Neill.

"I would have thought, with a little digging, you would find these guys [the Jiangsu fishermen] may well be part of it."

Image copyright Getty Images Image caption The HSU001

China doesn't just find underwater drones - it operates them, too.

At the military parade to mark the 70th anniversary of the People's Republic of China (PRC), the HSU001 was unveiled - a large UUV, possibly capable of launching smaller drones.

And five months earlier, another Chinese UUV was revealed in a less formal way, when Indonesian fishermen caught a "missile" with Chinese markings in the Riau Islands.

"It's not a missile, but a sea drone, which is usually used for underwater research," said police.

Although its origin was not confirmed, experts suspect it was part of China's vast sub-surface surveillance - the so-called "Great Underwater Wall of China".

So, as UUV technology develops, more fishermen - whether in China, Indonesia, or beyond - can expect to find more drones.

"They [drones] are extending the range of surveillance capacity for all of the modern navies in the region," says Mr Neill.

And - as the Jiangsu prize-winners discovered - they can be a valuable catch.

   Chinese student Wu Huayan died 'after donations withheld'

Anger is increasing in China after it was revealed only a fraction of the million yuan ($144,000; £111,000) donated to a severely malnourished student reached her before her death.

People across the country had given money to help Wu Huayan, whose plight emerged after she was taken to hospital with breathing difficulties last autumn.

The student, who weighed little more than 20kg (43lb), had been surviving on pennies a day for five years.

She later explained how she had watched both her father and grandmother die because they did not have enough money for medical care. She was determined not to let the same happen to her, with the media appeal her last chance.

And it appeared to work: the donations flooded in. But it wasn't enough to save Wu, who died on Monday aged 24.

Those who had been rooting for her were devastated, but there was worse to come. It transpired the money they had given - or at least the vast majority of it - never reached Wy Huayan. Official records seem to suggest just 20,000 yuan ($2,900; £2,225) was paid towards her hospital bills.

It has left many asking: how on earth did the system let this young woman down - and who exactly is to blame?

The campaign to save Wu Huayan

The first pictures of Wu Huayan - her 135cm (4ft 5ins) visibly emaciated - were released in October. She and her brother, who is understood to have mental health issues, had been relying on an uncle and aunt for support, but they could only provide 300 yuan ($43.60; £33.45) each month. After her brother's medical bills, there was only two yuan a day left for Miss Wu's food.

Immediately, people began to donate. The money was collected by Charity 9958, a project under the China Charities Aid Foundation for Children (CCAFC), using two different funding platforms. It was meant to help pay for heart surgery.

Image copyright Weibo Image caption The fundraising page drew in tens of thousands of yuan

But it never happened. According to reports, Miss Wu never gained enough weight to undergo the operation. According to official media, she weighed less than 30kg when she died.

The corruption allegations

Within days of her death, a scandal began to emerge. A state-media outlet called The Cover accused 9958 of running "a deadly scam".

Zheng Hehong, a prominent activist and former member of staff at 9958, came out alleging the charity sought out particularly ill or vulnerable people, and then withheld funds as part of a ploy to keep the proceeds as long as possible.

"They waited until the patient died so they could take the interest income," she told Phoenix New Media's Ifeng.com. "This income, by law, can be given as a staff bonus instead of charitable aid."

But the charity has hit back, saying it was holding onto the money on her family's request. They said it had not been paid because she had not met the criteria needed to undergo the surgery - and that it had planned to release the funds afterwards.

However, one acquaintance told The Cover that Ms Wu didn't even know about 400,000 yuan of the money.

Image copyright Pear Video Image caption Miss Wu arrived in hospital with breathing difficulties

Then, further complications: 9958 said it had stopped raising donations for Miss Wu after local government officials said that they would "take care" of the third year university student and her family.

The town has denied this, saying they had not been in contact with 9958.

A wider problem?

But is it all as simple as that? There have been a series of high profile scandals involving Chinese charities in recent years, journalist David Paulk points out in a Twitter thread.

They include charities set up to help girls but which gave money to boys, and one which used duplicate photos as it encouraged people to donate to impoverished children, the news editor of Sixth Tone explained in a Twitter thread.

But conversely, the CCAFC - the parent body of 9958 - was named China's most transparent charity in 2019 "achieving a perfect score of 100".

Image copyright People's Daily Image caption Pictures of eight-year-old Little Wang were shared tens of thousands of times

Regardless, BBC Monitoring's Kerry Allen says that China's official media have acknowledged that there has been "chaos and confusion" in China's charity industry. The official China Daily says that there are "too many overlapping authorities and liabilities", and called for better regulation, saying that online charity fraud has become rife.

The publicity surrounding stories like Ms Wu's has also left charities wary of taking on similar cases, for fear the repercussions of being blamed for not doing enough.

The South China Morning Post noted that Wang Fuman, an impoverished schoolboy who touched the nation's hearts after a picture of him with frost in his hair went viral, had been granted a happy ending by being offered a place at a private school. However, it was later retracted because the school could not cope with "the intense extra scrutiny from the authorities and pressure from the media".

China's government media has also been wary about the potential of families exploiting their children for online fame and donations. Wang Fuman's father told Inkstone News that funds donated to his son were withheld amid allegations the family were being "greedy" and distributed to other "ice boys". "Our family only received a small amount of money," he told the site.

But reports contradicting a "happy ending" in such cases have never reached mainland China, where media is heavily regulated.

Consequently, Ms Wu's death has angered social media users in the country, and led to suspicions that local governments are taking a cut of charity funds for themselves. Many have noted scandals where former officials in the impoverished region have been able to live a life of excess.

The government are likely to be keen to shift any blame away from their officials, as they have been working hard to paint them in more positive light and point towards successes in poverty alleviation.

China's Communist Party has said it wants to eradicate extreme poverty by the end of 2020, trumpeting success in places like Jiangsu province - which claims it has just 17 people living in poverty.

Stories like that of Ms Wu and her little brother, then, are not what it wants to see making headlines.

   Chinese birth rate falls to lowest in seven decades

   Image copyright VCG Image caption The end of the one-child policy has done little to reverse the falling birth rate

China's birth rate has fallen to its lowest since the formation of the People's Republic of China 70 years ago - despite the easing of the much criticised one-child policy.

The birth rate was 10.48 per 1,000 in 2019 - the lowest since 1949, the National Bureau of Statistics said.

The number of babies born in 2019 dropped by 580,000 to 14.65 million.

The country's birth rate has been falling for years - posing a challenge for the world's second-biggest economy.

Despite the birth rate falling, a lower death rate meant China's population hit 1.4bn in 2019, inching up from 1.39bn.

But the falling birth rate is raising fears of a "demographic timebomb" - that is, a smaller working-age population having to support a bigger, retired population.

China's falling birth rate

China's birth rate is lower than the US, which stood at 12 per 1,000 people in 2017 (the most recent data available), but higher than Japan's figure of 8.

In England and Wales, the birth rate was 11.6 in 2019, compared with 9 in Scotland. In Northern Ireland the figure was 12.1 in 2018 (the most recent data available).

The overall global birth rate was 18.65 in 2017, according to the World Bank.

In 1979, the Chinese government introduced a nationwide "one-child policy" - with various exceptions - to slow population growth.

Families that violated the rules faced fines, loss of employment and sometimes forced abortions.

But the policy has been blamed for a severe gender imbalance - with males still outnumbering females by more than 30 million in the 2019 figures.

In 2015, the government ended its one-child policy, allowing couples to have two children.

But that reform has failed to reverse the country's falling birth rate - despite a two-year increase immediately afterwards.

Experts say this is because the relaxing of the policy did not come with other relevant changes that support family life - such as monetary support for child care and increased paternity leave.

Most people can't afford more than one child, they say.

Although she has since deleted them, they quickly went viral and people urged the site to offer an explanation.

The site's Palace Museum said it was "deeply distressed and sincerely apologises to the public".

A statement confirmed that the incident had happened on Monday.

The Forbidden City was China's former imperial palace between the years 1420 and 1912. It is a World Heritage Site and one of the most heavily-guarded areas of China.

How did this happen?

When social media users saw pictures uploaded to the popular Sina Weibo microblog by Ms Lu on 17 January, inside the empty site on a clear day, people quickly started asking questions.

Currently, it is Spring Festival, one of China's biggest public holidays, when there is mass migration across China to popular tourist destinations. Beijing and its landmarks at this time of year are notoriously flooded with people.

Ms Lu posted several pictures on her Weibo account saying "On Monday the Palace Museum is closed, so I hurried over, hid from the crowds, and went to play in the Forbidden City."

Weibo users were stunned to see not only pictures of Ms Lu and her friend at an empty site, but also her huge luxury car, which she drove onto the complex.

The Forbidden City often closes on Mondays, to allow for maintenance and renovation work.

Who is she?

Today, the hashtag #DrivingIntoTheForbiddenCity has quickly gone viral, and has been used hundreds of thousands of times.

Users acknowledge that Ms Lu has deleted her original pictures, but as one user, whose comment has been shared more than 400,000 times, says: "Deleting the pictures is useless; the entire Chinese nation has seen them." They wanted the Palace Museum to explain.

Many users have speculated that the woman is from a wealthy background, given that previous posts on her account show her on a luxury yacht.

Her Weibo account says that she is flight attendant at Air China, but the airline has responded to media questions saying that she "left the company a number of years ago".

Influential local paper Beijing News says that a woman claiming to be her friend, says she was invited by the Palace Museum to attend an event.

Ms Lu herself has not commented publicly.

Why is this controversial?

The Forbidden City is a huge complex of significant cultural and historical importance. Made up of courtyards, palaces and gardens, it is home to imperial collections of Ming and Qing dynasty art and artefacts.

Its main entrance is famous for a portrait of Mao Zedong, the founder of the Chinese Communist Party, and next to the government building, the Great Hall of the People, and the symbolic Tiananmen Square.

China has strict laws on the protection of cultural relics, and has previously blacklisted people for vandalising important sites.

This is not the first time the Forbidden City has come under fire for controversial pictures at the site.

In June 2015, images circulated of a naked photoshoot outside the Palace Museum.

The official China Daily said at the time that the model could face a number of days in detention, but similarly raised questions about "ethical and moral" behaviour at a "historical site".

Around 1,500 chefs in the southern Indian state of Kerala came together to bake a vanilla cake - and as you can imagine, it was no ordinary confectionery treat.

The cake, which was made with 12,000kg (26,455 lbs) of sugar and flour, stretched for more than six kilometres (3.7 miles), and is believed to be the world's longest.

The chefs were trying to break the world record for the longest cake. That honour is currently held by Chinese chefs who baked a cake about half as long in 2018.

When tennis player Dalila Jakupovic was unable to complete her qualifying match for the Australia Open, which begins on Monday, she blamed the "unhealthy" air quality caused by fire smoke. Bushfires have been burning across Australia for weeks, causing air pollution which can be harmful to health.

Ms Jakupovic criticised the organisers for letting the match go ahead in those conditions, as she and several other tennis players experienced effects, including coughing and difficulty breathing, nausea and muscle cramps.

How harmful is bushfire smoke?

Breathing in smoke can cause irritation in the eyes, nose, throat and lungs. In more serious cases it can lead to hospital, especially for people with pre-existing respiratory conditions.

As trees, leaves and other ground vegetation burn, they release small particles of solid carbon, water vapour and gases including carbon monoxide.

Ultrafine particles of less than 2.5 micrometers - referred to as PM2.5 - pose the biggest risk to health because they can bury deep into the lungs and even enter the blood stream. This risks irritation, infection and an increased chance of heart attacks and lung disease.

Professor Francesca Dominici, a statistician who works on public health, conducted a recent study into the effects of exposure to particulate matter. She found it was linked to hospital admissions for a wider range of conditions than previously thought.

As well as the known effects on the lungs and heart, her team identified "new diseases including septicaemia which is a serious bloodstream infection... urinary tract infections and renal failure," she told ABC News.

Bushfire pollution does not typically do as much lasting damage as traffic or industry pollution, according to Associate Prof Brian Oliver, an expert in respiratory disease from the University of Technology, Sydney, because conditions often lift with a change in weather.

This means any breathing discomfort is mostly short-lived.

But because many fires have been burning for weeks, and authorities warn that there is no immediate end in sight, experts say this should now be treated as medium-term exposure.

Who is this affecting?

Bushfires have been burning across the country, often sending smoke over populated areas.

Residents of Sydney - Australia's largest city - have endured smoke for weeks. The city's air quality has exceeded "hazardous" levels on several occasions.

That has led to a 10% rise in hospital admissions, say officials. Paramedics have treated hundreds of people for breathing problems.

Adelaide - a city of 1.3 million - was also affected last month, with its residents told to stay indoors.

Because PM2.5 particles found in bushfire smoke are so small - a ninth of the size of a grain of sand - they can travel huge distances on the wind, potentially affecting many more people. The smoke is expected to make "at least one full circuit around the globe," according to the US space agency Nasa.

Most vulnerable are children, the elderly and smokers, while those with asthma, heart and lung problems can see exacerbated symptoms - such as chest tightness and difficulty breathing.

And, as competitors in the Australia Open tennis tournament have experienced, athletes can be more susceptible to smoke damage because they are breathing in larger volumes of air as they exercise.

The more intense the exercise, the more extra air will be taken in.

Standard face masks are ineffective when it comes to blocking out fine particles, according to health authorities. They warned people to avoid exercising outdoors this week - a suggestion that many have ignored.

Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Many have continued to exercise outdoors despite the risks

How bad has Australia's air quality been?

Australia's clear air standard is a PM2.5 level of eight micrograms per cubic metre. By comparison, smoking a single cigarette produces 20 micrograms per cubic metre.

Recent readings in Sydney have been as high as 734 micrograms - the equivalent of about 37 cigarettes.

What about 'thunderstorm asthma'?

Smoke is an obvious health hazard that can travel vast distances from the fire front. But the weather stoking the flames has created other issues too, such as dust storms.

In Victoria, officials issued an "extreme" warning in November for a phenomenon known as "thunderstorm asthma".

This is where strong winds create more pollen in the air, which can lead to an outbreak of asthma attacks. In 2016, nine people died in Melbourne from just such an outbreak.

Bushfires can actually create their own weather systems, which may exacerbate this effect, according to Rachel Badlan, a researcher at the University of New South Wales.

If it covers a large enough area, the upward movement of hot air from a fire can interact with the atmosphere and form a pyrocumulonimbus - a cloud of smoke, ash and water vapour which comes alongside massive thunderstorms.

Pollutants from these storms are flung into the stratosphere - more than 10km into the earth's atmosphere - according to Nasa.

   Image caption More than 100 bushfires are still burning in New South Wales

Record-breaking temperatures and months of severe drought have fuelled a series of massive bushfires across Australia.

Although recent cooler conditions and rain have brought some respite, more than 100 fires are still burning in the states of New South Wales and Victoria.

Some 28 people have so far been killed - including four firefighters - and an estimated 10 million hectares (100,000 sq km or 15.6 million acres) of bush, forest and parks across Australia has burned.

New South Wales and Victoria have been worst affected

In the worst-hit state, New South Wales (NSW), fire has affected more than five million hectares, destroying more than 2,000 houses and forcing thousands to seek shelter elsewhere.

There were 105 fires burning in the bush, mountain forests and national parks across NSW on 13 January, the Rural Fire Service said, with 38 uncontained.

Two large fires on the border between NSW and Victoria have merged into a so-called "mega blaze".

Victoria, where fires have burned 1.2 million hectares, extended a "state of disaster" for the worst-hit areas from 2 to 11 January, allowing authorities to enforce evacuations and let emergency services take over properties.

Three people - including one firefighter - have died in Victoria and around 20 fires are burning.

The military has sent troops, ships and aircraft to the region to help relocation and firefighting efforts.

What's Australia doing to fight the bushfires?

South Australia has also suffered

Two people and an estimated 25,000 koalas were killed when flames devastated Kangaroo Island in the state of South Australia last week

The island is renowned for its unique mix of animal species.

Experts have expressed concerns over the survival of endangered species on the island which include the dunnart - a mouse-like marsupial - and the black glossy cockatoo.

Tens of thousands of farm animals, mainly sheep, were also killed in the fire.

Videos posted on social media have shown efforts to rescue Koalas which survived the blazes.

Elsewhere in South Australia, the Cudlee Creek fire is reported to have destroyed more than 80 homes in the Adelaide Hills region.

Fires are also thought to have destroyed up to a third of the vines that provide grapes for the Adelaide Hills wine industry.

Smoke from fires has become a major hazard

The Australian capital Canberra - part of an administrative region surrounded by NSW - has seen some of the worst smoke pollution, with air quality rated the third worst of all major global cities on 3 January, according to Swiss-based group AirVisual.

Satellite images from 4 January show the spread of smoke from fires in Victoria and NSW, which has affected air quality as far away as New Zealand.

The fires have been worse than usual

Although Australia has always had bushfires, this season has been a lot worse than normal.

The total area of land affected by fires across Australia - 10 million hectares - is now comparable to England's land area of 13 million hectares.

Humans are sometimes to blame for starting the fires, but they are also often sparked by natural causes, such as lightning striking dry vegetation.

Once fires have started, other areas are at risk, with embers blown by the wind causing blazes to spread to new areas.

Bush fires themselves can also drive thunderstorms, increasing the risk of lightning strikes and further fires.

The number of people killed as a result of the fires since September 2019 is higher than in recent years.

Australia's deadliest bushfire disaster was "Black Saturday" in February 2009, when some 180 people died in Victoria.

If there is a serious risk of fire reaching homes or properties, authorities urge people to leave in good time as fire can travel fast - faster than most people can run.

So is this down to climate change?

Many Australians are asking that very question - but the science is complicated.

Scientists have long warned that a hotter, drier climate will contribute to fires becoming more frequent and more intense. Many parts of Australia have been in drought conditions, some for years, which has made it easier for the fires to spread and grow.

Data shows that Australia has warmed overall by slightly more than one degree Celsius since 1910, with most of the heating occurring since 1950, the Bureau of Meteorology says.

Australia broke its all-time temperature record twice in December. An average maximum of 40.9C was recorded on 17 December, broken a day later by 41.9C, both beating 2013's record of 40.3C.

By the end of the month every state had measured temperatures above 40C - including Tasmania, which is usually much cooler than the mainland.

A climate phenomenon is behind the heatwave

The main climate driver behind the heat has been a positive Indian Ocean Dipole (IOD) - an event where sea surface temperatures are warmer in the western half of the ocean, cooler in the east.

The difference between the two temperatures is currently the strongest in 60 years.

As a result, there has been higher-than-average rainfall and floods in eastern Africa and droughts in south-east Asia and Australia.

Andrew Watkins, head of long-range forecasts at the bureau, said the dipole was crucial to understanding the heatwave.

"The key culprit of our current and expected conditions is one of the strongest positive Indian Ocean dipole events on record," he says.

"A positive IOD means we have cooler than average water pooling off Indonesia, and this means we see less rain-bearing weather systems, and warmer than average temperatures for large parts of the country."

And meteorologists warn that, for the moment, the intense weather and elevated fire risk in Australia is set to continue.

"I don't really want to shake your hand."

"You won't be getting any votes down here buddy... you're out."

"What about the people who are dead now, Mr Prime Minister? What about the people who have nowhere to live?"

As Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison toured a bushfire-ravaged town on Thursday, he was loudly heckled by locals. The anger towards him in Cobargo, New South Wales, was palpable. But most awkward - and attention-grabbing - were two quieter encounters.

In one, Mr Morrison approached a woman and asked "how are you?" When she failed to meet his hand, he reached down and lifted hers for a limp handshake.

She responded: "I'm only shaking your hand if you give more money to RFS [Rural Fire Service]. So many people have lost their homes."

"I understand," he replied. As he walked away, she added: "We need more help."

Image copyright Reuters Image caption Mr Morrison was criticised online for lifting the woman's hand

After a firefighter separately refused to shake his hand, Mr Morrison said to his aides: "Tell that fella I'm really sorry, I'm sure he's just tired." A local official responded: "No, no, he lost a house."

The exchanges, all filmed and widely shared, have again focused public ire on Mr Morrison over his handling of an unprecedented bushfire crisis. The prime minister has faced persistent accusations of being too absent, including by taking a holiday to Hawaii, and underplaying the role of climate change.

Fires as big as small countries

Since September, blazes across Australia have killed 20 people, razed more than 1,200 homes and scorched millions of hectares. Though much attention has centred on worst-hit NSW, every state and territory has been affected.

Smoke has shrouded towns and cities in Australia's most populated south-east, bringing hazardous air quality to millions of people. Millions of animals are estimated to have perished, and the economic cost is predicted to be enormous.

Public gratitude has been boundless for the fatigued firefighters - overwhelmingly volunteers - who have battled blazes as big as small countries. Three have died on duty. Fire service chiefs, such as Commissioner Shane Fitzsimmons in NSW, have often been the face of the crisis.

To critics of Mr Morrison, those chiefs have provided a stark contrast in leadership. On Friday, a high-profile member of Mr Morrison's own party made a withering critique.

"The only two people who are providing leadership at this stage are Shane Fitzsimmons and [NSW Premier] Gladys Berejiklian," Andrew Constance, the state transport minister, told Seven News.

Of the heckling, Mr Constance added: "To be honest, the locals probably gave him the welcome he probably deserved."

What has prompted the anger?

Early in the crisis, criticism centred on Mr Morrison's reluctance to discuss how climate change is exacerbating bushfires - a link acknowledged by Australia's Bureau of Meteorology.

Though he has since acknowledged it as a factor, the conservative leader maintains there is no direct link between the fires and his climate policies. This has continued to cause controversy because of Australia's reliance on coal mining.

But as the fires have spread, Mr Morrison has been accused of "going missing" in other ways. Most prominently, he took a holiday to Hawaii last month as many blazes intensified - prompting him to later apologise for causing "great anxiety" with his timing.

A New Year's Day cricket event, where he said Australians would soon be gathering round TV sets to be "inspired by the great feats of our cricketers", was accused of being "tone deaf".

Many have called on the government to better fund Australia's largely unpaid firefighting services, pointing to an extraordinary strain on resources, and arguing that smaller communities are being disadvantaged.

A group of ex-fire chiefs has argued a new long-term firefighting strategy is needed, but they have criticised Mr Morrison for refusing to meet them.

Mr Morrison found himself in even more hot water on Saturday when he tweeted a video, authorised by his Liberal Party, trumpeting the government's latest measures to tackle the fires.

Skip Twitter post by @ScottMorrisonMP We’re putting more Defence Force boots on the ground, more planes in the sky, more ships to sea, and more trucks to roll in to support the bushfire fighting effort and recovery as part of our co-ordinated response to these terrible #bushfires pic.twitter.com/UiOeYB2jnv — Scott Morrison (@ScottMorrisonMP) January 4, 2020 Report

To a backdrop of upbeat music, the video highlights the 3,000 defence force reservists called in, as well as extra water-bombing aircraft and other resources to bolster the operation.

The Liberal Party also tweeted the extra measures in an advert saying "our Defence Force is providing boots on the ground, planes in the sky and ships at sea, to support the bushfire fighting effort and recovery".

Mr Morrison's critics accused his government of using the bushfires - and the military - for political campaigning.

The Australia Defence Association lobby group said the Liberal Party advert was a "clear breach" of conventions aimed at keeping the military out of politics.

The association accused the party of "milking ADF support to civil agencies fighting bushfires".

Pat Conroy, shadow minister for international development, said Mr Morrison was trying to "exploit a national tragedy".

He described the advert as a "new low".

What does Morrison say?

After initially saying the firefighters "want to be there", the prime minister recently pledged compensation for volunteers who miss work to fight fires, and an additional A$11m (£5.8m; $7.7m) for firefighting aircraft.

He has resisted calls for further funding, but frequently paid tribute to firefighters. He has emphasised a prolonged drought as a key reason for causing dry conditions which fuel fires.

Skip Twitter post 2 by @ScottMorrisonMP Australians should be assured every possible resource is being committed to fighting these fires and supporting the communities affected in every possible way we can. We will get through this but we need to stay strong and stay together. — Scott Morrison (@ScottMorrisonMP) January 3, 2020 Report

When asked on Friday why he had been heckled, he told 3AW radio: "Because people are hurting and angry. Whether they are angry with me or angry about the situation, all I know is they're hurting."

He has maintained that Australia will meet its climate commitments - an assertion disputed by the UN and others - but that deeper action would not take precedence over "reckless" cuts to jobs in fossil fuel industries.

Mr Morrison has called on Australians not to panic and to pull together. He has repeatedly said it was up to each state to arrange their emergency response - the best tactic is to let them get on with their job, he has said.

His supporters say he can't be held responsible for the sort of natural disaster which has always struck Australia, nor fix it by knee-jerk policy U-turns.

Mr Morrison also hit back at the criticism of his tweeted video, saying: "The video message simply communicates the government's policy decisions and the actions the government is undertaking to the public."

'You will be judged'

Mr Morrison was returned last May in a surprise election victory that led many to hail him as a shrewd, instinctive politician. But for some, his bushfire response has stirred incredulity.

"You are watching the destruction of a political leader and this time not by his own party but by his own hand," tweeted one veteran commentator, Barrie Cassidy, after the Cobargo footage. Another, Ten's Hugh Riminton, wrote: "I have never seen a PM so openly disdained during a national disaster."

Not all have been been so critical. Victoria's Premier Daniel Andrews, a Labor politician, thanked Mr Morrison for providing assistance as bushfires swept through the state this week. Liz Innes, a mayor of a shire near Cobargo, apologised to Mr Morrison for those who had heckled him, the ABC reported.

The federal Labor opposition, too, has often appeared reluctant to directly criticise Mr Morrison. It has also been accused of courting pro-coal voters in the wake of its election loss.

Australia was the fourth largest producer of coal in 2017, according to the International Energy Agency. It also has one of the highest per capita greenhouse gas emission rates globally. The 2020 Climate Change Performance Index ranked Australia last of 57 countries for its climate policy, saying it had gone backwards under the Morrison government.

Many including John Hewson, a former leader of Mr Morrison's Liberal Party, argue that the prime minister's "hang-ups on the climate issue" are holding him back on the fire crisis.

"The die is already cast on your government and, if you continue as you have been doing, time will not be your friend," Mr Hewson wrote in the Sydney Morning Herald.

"Ultimately, you will be judged on authenticity and policy outcomes - on genuine leadership."

   How did Australia fires start and what is being done? A very simple guide.

Australia is fighting one of its worst bushfire seasons, fuelled by record-breaking temperatures and months of severe drought.

Since September, at least 25 people have died and thousands have been made homeless.

Here's a very simple guide to what's going on:

Where are the fires?

Every state and territory in Australia has experienced fires this summer. But the biggest fires burn along stretches of the eastern and southern coast, where most of the population lives.

This includes areas around Sydney and Adelaide.

How big are the Australia fires?

More than 6.3 million hectares (63,000 sq km or 15.6 million acres) have been burned so far - one hectare is roughly the size of a sports field.

Image copyright EPA

To put that in perspective, around 800,000 hectares in 2018 in California.

How did the Australia fires start?

Australia has always experienced bushfires - it has a "fire season". But this year they are a lot worse than normal.

Fires are usually caused by lightning strikes or accidentally by a spark - but some fires are also started deliberately.

Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Sydney has been covered by thick smoke from bushfires outside of the city

Are the Australia fires caused by climate change?

This year a natural weather phenomenon known as the Indian Ocean Dipole has meant a hot, dry spell across the country.

But the overwhelming scientific consensus is that rising levels of CO2 are warming the planet. And Australia has been getting hotter over recent decades and is expected to continue doing so.

This year, Australia twice set a new temperature record: an average maximum of 41.9C was recorded on 18 December. That comes on top of a long period of drought.

Scientists have long warned that this hotter, drier climate will contribute to fires becoming more frequent and more intense.

The more extreme weather patterns and higher temperatures increase the risk of bushfires and allow them to spread faster and wider.

How are the fires fought?

Firefighters are spraying water and fire retardant from planes and helicopters as well as from the ground.

But fighting bush fires is extremely difficult and often authorities have to focus on just stopping the spread, rather than putting the fire out.

The spread can for instance be contained by digging earth boundaries to stop the flames from spreading. The priority is saving lives.

Who is fighting the fires?

Professional firefighters are the first in line to battle the flames, but they are outnumbered by the thousands of volunteers. Three of them have died.

There's also help coming from abroad: the US, Canada, and New Zealand have sent firefighters to help.

Australia's police, military and navy are involved in rescue and evacuation efforts.

How many animals have died in the fires?

While people can flee the fires and are being evacuated if need be, the flames are devastating wildlife in the affected areas.

One study estimated that half a billion animals have died in NSW alone. Read more on how they reached that conclusion here.

But the fires don't only kill animals directly, they also destroy the habitat, leaving the survivors vulnerable even once the fires have gone. So the true scale of loss isn't yet clear.

Experts say more than 100,000 cows and sheep may also have been lost, which is devastating for farmers.

What is the government doing?

Each state runs its own emergency operation, but Prime Minister Scott Morrison has promised better funding for firefighting and payouts for volunteer firefighters, and an additional A$2bn ($1.4bn; £1bn) for the recovery.

But the national government has come under strong criticism from its opponents that it's not been doing enough against climate change.

The country is one of the world's biggest per capita greenhouse gas emitters but under international agreements it has committed itself to reduction targets.

Mr Morrison has repeatedly defended his government's stance.

Large parts of Australia have been devastated by the worst wildfires the country has seen in decades, with huge blazes tearing through bush, woodland and national parks.

Record-breaking temperatures and months of drought have helped the fires burn an estimated 10 million hectares (100,000 sq km) of land since 1 July.

What are the Australian authorities doing to stop the fires and could anything have been done to prevent them?

Fighting the fires is a huge task

Bushfire conditions eased over the weekend, giving fire crews a period of temporary respite. But authorities say the huge fires will persist until there is substantial rainfall. More hot weather is expected next week and the risk was far from over, they said.

Thousands of firefighters are still battling blazes across large swathes of Australia - ranging in size from small fires to infernos burning across hectares of land.

Entire towns have been engulfed and residents across several states have lost their homes. At least 28 people have died.

State and federal authorities have been working together to try to stem the spread. While they have managed to contain some within a matter of days, the biggest blazes have been burning for months.

Many people are involved in the battle

At least 3,700 firefighters are on the ground at any one time across the country during the worst periods, according to the country's state fire services. Most are in the worst-hit states of New South Wales (NSW) and Victoria.

When fires have been at their worst, about 2,700 firefighters have been battling the blazes at any one time in NSW alone.

Ben Shepherd, of the NSW Rural Fire Service, said his colleagues had dealt with 4.2m hectares of burning land this season, compared with the typical 300,000 hectares.

"It's been an incredibly long campaign," he said.

Fire crews across the country have been joined by 3,000 army, navy and air force reservists who are assisting with search and rescue and clean-up efforts.

Further support coming from the US, Canada, and New Zealand, who have sent additional teams and equipment to help.

They're using a lot of kit

Fire crews are using a combination of aircraft and land-based equipment to fight the fires.

NSW Rural Fire Service says it has about 100 aircraft in the skies every day when the fires are bad, while Victoria Country Fire Authority says it has more than 60.

They include helicopters, fixed-wing aircraft and larger air-tankers, most of which can be used to "firebomb" water onto fires or drop retardant from the sky above.

Overall, more than 500 aircraft are available for firefighting across Australia, according to the National Aerial Firefighting Centre, which has its own fleet of about 130 aircraft ready to help boost a state's response when required.

Prime Minister Scott Morrison has also committed $14m to leasing firefighting aircraft from overseas.

The dangers facing crews were highlighted on Thursday, when a waterbombing helicopter crashed into a reservoir in the Bega Valley Shire region as it was refilling. The pilot, contracted by the Rural Fire Service, survived.

On the ground, teams are also using firefighting trucks and "heavy plant" equipment, such as bulldozers and excavators, in order to move earth, clear areas of debris and create "firebreaks" - gaps in vegetation that help slow the advance of flames.

NSW Rural Fire Service says it has more than 750 vehicles on the ground on a given day.

Military aircraft and navy cruisers are also being used alongside Australian fire service kit.

The army said it had sent supplies, personnel, and vehicles to the devastated Kangaroo Island, near the city of Adelaide in South Australia.

The army also sent out reconnaissance and assistance missions in NSW and Victoria.

But the government has faced criticism for its response

The prime minister - a keen supporter of the country's coal industry - has faced fierce criticism over his apparent failure to anticipate the crisis, his slow response to the disaster and his reluctance to accept a link between the bushfires and climate change.

Mr Morrison was forced to apologise for going on a family holiday to Hawaii last month as the crisis escalated and he has been heckled by locals in NSW and Victoria.

In response, the Australian leader has expressed regret over his handling of the crisis and said he would seek a royal commission review - a type of public inquiry - into the country's response. He has also promised A$2bn ($1.4bn; £1.1bn) in aid to help the country recover

But the prime minister is being urged to do more to cut Australia's carbon emissions and tackle climate change, which is seeing the country's average temperatures rise.

Tens of thousands of people across Australia took part in climate change protests last week.

The latest figures from Australia's Bureau of Meteorology show 2019 was the country's hottest and driest year on record.

The conditions were caused by a climate phenomenon called a positive Indian Ocean Dipole (IOD), which was unusually strong, a rare Sudden Stratospheric Warming event, which pushed weather systems northward, as well as climate change, the bureau said.

Last year's annual mean temperature was 1.52 degrees Celsius above the 1961-1990 average of 21.8C - higher than the previous record of 1.33 degrees Celsius in 2013.

Australia's state of the climate report, published last year, warned that warming temperatures meant there had been a "long-term increase in extreme fire weather" as well as an extension in the "length of the fire season".

But there have been warnings of Australia's increased levels of fire risk since 1988 - and a 2007 report by Australia's federal science agency predicted more intense fires would be seen by 2020, says Dr Tim Curran, senior lecturer in ecology at Lincoln University in New Zealand.

The scale and intensity of this year's fires and the fact they are now more likely to become a common phenomenon means the Australian authorities may well have to take further steps to prepare in future years.

Professor Dale Dominey-Howes, director of the Asia-Pacific Natural Hazards and Disaster Risk Research Group at the University of Sydney, argues the current bushfire crisis - and the fact it is affecting multiple states and territories simultaneously - represented a "new normal" and the government needed to act.

"We need new approaches to disaster management - a professional paid workforce, capable of round the clock, round the year and around the country deployment, capable of responding to multiple disaster types," he says.

   Australia fires: Does controlled burning really work?

As Australia battles unprecedented fires this year, a debate is under way about what is called "controlled burning" as a means to stop fires spreading.

This involves deliberately starting fires under controlled conditions to clear out low-lying flammable material - sometimes called "prescribed" or "hazard reduction burning".

It is not the same as "back burning", which is done as a last resort to try to slow down an approaching wildfire by stripping the ground of vegetation.

Some politicians in Australia have blamed environmental activism for stopping controlled fires because of their impact on wildlife and fauna.

So what is the truth behind these claims, and does controlled burning really work?

What is being said about controlled burning?

The issue is part of a dispute between the Australian Greens and some other political parties.

The Greens say the major parties need to do more to tackle climate change.

Other politicians have hit back, such as National Party MP Barnaby Joyce who has pointed to what he says is the Greens' opposition to controlled burning.

He thinks the practice should happen more frequently to stop wildfires, and that you need to burn off flammable vegetation otherwise you increase the risk of fires spreading.

Getty It’s not burning because they burnt off - it’s burning because they didn’t burn off.

Prime Minister Scott Morrison has said those "who say they want action on climate change" could be "the same people who don't share the same urgency of dealing with hazard reduction".

But the Australian Greens - who are not in the government at either national or state level - have made clear they support controlled burning if it is carried out under expert guidance.

The Greens told the BBC that these accusations have been made for some years.

"We've never done anything to prevent or even restrict hazard reduction burning," they said.

Does controlled burning work?

Done properly, it can help limit the spread of fires and make it easier to put them out.

But Swansea University professor Stefan Doerr, an expert in wildfires, believes the practice is less effective than it used to be because of the more extreme weather Australia has started to experience.

"It can make a difference for a few years, but I'm doubtful it would make a difference in the current extreme drought conditions," he said.

Image copyright Getty Images Image caption This year's fires have been particularly hot and intense

He adds that a particular feature of the recent fires in Australia is that they have spread across the crown or top part of the forest - so removing growth at ground level does not make that much difference.

Also the fires have been hot and intense enough to burn through areas that were already burned, with embers able to travel through the air and ignite areas far away from an active fire.

How much controlled burning has there been?

Australian firefighters have a long history of carrying out this type of burning to reduce fire risk. "They are some of the most experienced and well-trained in the world," says Prof Doerr.

Burning to prevent fires is regulated and carried out by state agencies like the relevant fire service, park authority or environment body.

In areas of special environmental value or near heritage sites, national level permission is needed, according to the Department of the Environment and Energy.

An analysis by ABC News shows that while some controlled burning targets in Queensland and New South Wales have been met, others have not because the weather conditions were not right.

The NSW Rural Fire Service report for 2018-19 reveals that although they exceeded targets for reducing fire hazards in parks and forested areas, they fell short of their targets for local government land, privately-owned land and other areas.

Getty Prolonged drought conditions adversely affected the ability to complete hazard reduction work.

Controlled burning can only be done in cooler, damper weather with low wind speeds, to avoid the fire getting out of control.

In 2015, a fire that was started by the Victoria state authorities to burn off hazardous undergrowth ran out of control, destroying four homes and more than 3,000 hectares of farmland and forest.

Some experts argue there needs to be a review of how money is spent dealing with fire risks in a hotter, drier climate.

Rod Keenan, of the University of Melbourne, who has called for a more integrated approach to land management, says: "A lot of resources have gone into extra fire trucks, hoses and getting volunteers. We're not putting sufficient resources into land management."

So while controlled burning does have its place, it is just one part of a broader strategy needed to combat the more extreme fires Australia now faces.

   Australia fires: Plants photographed regrowing in ashes

   Image copyright Murray Lowe Image caption Green grasses growing in parts of Kulnura which were on fire three weeks previously

The unprecedented bushfires sweeping parts of Australia have devastated huge areas of the country's natural environment.

At least half a billion animals and countless trees, plants and other living things have been killed since the fires began in September.

More than 6.3 million hectares (63,000 sq km or 15.6 million acres) have been burned so far - one hectare is roughly the size of a sports field.

But in some recently-burned areas, signs of life are returning, as captured by local photographer Murray Lowe, who went to investigate how fire had affected the bush near his home in Kulnura on Central Coast, New South Wales.

Walking on the grey ash, next to mobile phone masts downed by the fire that ravaged the area in late December, he found green grasses and rose-coloured leaves sprouting through burnt tree trunks.

The photos have been shared thousands of times on social media since Mr Lowe, who's 71, posted them on Monday, as people search for hope amid the devastation.

Image copyright Murray Lowe Image caption Some plant species have evolved to re-sprout very quickly after fire

A keen photographer, Mr Lowe wanted to document the fire-hit areas as a break from his "normal coastal sunrise images".

Driving through Kulnura, he stopped at the edge of Dhurag National Park, in a small residential community which largely survived the fire.

"The ground puffed up ash into the air from each footstep as we walked among the tree trunks in the eerie silence and stillness that only fires of this intensity can produce in aftermath," Mr Lowe, a retired vehicle inspector, explained.

Seeing the plants regrowing so quickly gave him hope, after witnessing what seemed like "total destruction".

"This was the sign of renewal we had been seeking. We were witnessing the rebirth of a forest that Australia is so well-known for," he said.

The 14,850 hectare Dhurag National Park, which remains closed due to fire threat, is home to several species only found in south-west Australia, including the gymea lily.

Is this recovery normal?

Yes - these plant species have experienced frequent fires for tens of millions of years. This has created an evolutionary pressure for them to develop the ability to recover after being burnt, explained Dr Kimberley Simpson, a fire ecology expert at the University of Sheffield.

Plants have evolved two ways of doing this.

The first is resprouting, which is clearly visible in the photographs, according to Dr Simpson.

Many Australian tree species, including most Eucalyptus species, have epicormics buds, which are set deep beneath thick bark and are insulated from intense heat. Many shrubs and grasses are also protected by fire by insulating layer of soil, meaning they can resprout quickly.

Image copyright Murray Lowe Image caption Some species have buds deeply buried in bark, insulating them from intense heat

The second way in which plant species recover quickly is through regeneration from heat-resistant seeds.

In fact, growth conditions are optimal after a fire for small seedlings, due to ample light and nutrients released from ash. Dr Simpson explained that it is "common to see a rapid greening of the ground after fire".

However, there is no evidence of this process in Mr Lowe's photographs, said Dr Simpson, because these seeds need rain to germinate and there has no been no rain in Kulnara since the fires.

Will this happen all over fire-hit Australia?

Regeneration after fire occurs over years - some species resprout soon after fire, and others take longer.

However, the size and severity of this season's fires "raise concerns about the survival of species that are adapted to fire", said Dr Simpson.

She said the high temperatures the fires are reaching, combined with the unprecedented drought in many parts of Australia, are likely to cause high plant mortality.

"We may see local extinctions in cases where species are pushed beyond their ability to recover," she suggested.

Particularly concerning is the impact of fire in Australia's rainforests, which don't normally experience fire, and are poorly equipped to recover after being burned.

   Australia fires: Aboriginal planners say the bush 'needs to burn'

   Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Aboriginal people have long used techniques to manage fires

For thousands of years, the Indigenous people of Australia set fire to the land.

Long before Australia was invaded and colonised by Europeans, fire management techniques - known as "cultural burns" - were being practised.

The cool-burning, knee-high blazes were designed to happen continuously and across the landscape.

The fires burn up fuel like kindling and leaf detritus, meaning a natural bushfire has less to devour.

Since Australia's fire crisis began last year, calls for better reintegration of this technique have grown louder. But it should have happened sooner, argues one Aboriginal knowledge expert.

"The bush needs to burn," says Shannon Foster.

She's a knowledge keeper for the D'harawal people - relaying information passed on by her elders - and an Aboriginal Knowledge lecturer at the University of Technology Sydney (UTS).

Much of the ancestral information she shares relates to the bush, says Ms Foster.

"It's the concept of maintaining country - central to everything we do as Aboriginal people. It's about what we can give back to country; not just what we can take from it."

'Naive' techniques of today

Country is personified within Aboriginal culture. "The earth is our mother. She keeps us alive," Ms Foster says. This relationship shifts priorities around precautionary burning.

While modern-day authorities do carry out hazard reduction burning, focusing on protecting lives and property, Ms Foster says it's "clearly not working".

"The current controlled burns destroy everything. It's a naive way to practise fire management, and it isn't hearing the Indigenous people who know the land best.

"Whereas cultural burning protects the environment holistically. We're interested in looking after country, over property and assets.

"We can't eat, drink or breathe assets. Without country, we have nothing."

Indigenous cultural burns work within the rhythms of the environment, attracting marsupials and mammals which Aboriginal people could hunt.

"Cool burning replenishes the earth and enhances biodiversity - the ash fertilises and the potassium encourages flowering. It's a complex cycle based on cultural, spiritual and scientific knowledge."

They also create a mosaic of ecologies, Ms Foster says, and this can lead to beneficial micro-climates.

"Soft burning encourages rain - it warms the environment to a particular atmospheric level, and once the warm and the cool meet, condensation - rain - occurs, helping mitigate fires."

Her Aboriginal elders in Sydney have been assessing the overgrown bush and extremely dry kindling for some time, warning that a huge fire is coming: "They compared it to a kid with unkempt hair, saying it needs nurturing."

But local authorities have forbidden them from cultural burning when they've asked for permission.

Where cultural burning is used

There's no one-size-fits-all approach to precautionary burning because the Australian landscape is so diverse from place to place.

Nonetheless, some states do integrate cultural burning with other strategies, according to Dr Richard Thornton, CEO of the Bushfire and Natural Hazards Cooperative Research Centre.

"There's a stark difference in northern Australia, where Indigenous cultural burning happens substantially. In southern states, it's sometimes done according to the needs and wishes of local communities."

Image copyright AFP/Getty Images Image caption The bushfire crisis has devastated Australia since September

Since Australia was colonised in 1788, cultural burning was slowly eradicated. But recent years have seen moves to reintegrate it.

Associate Prof Noel Preece, a former national parks ranger, wrote the first fire manual for central Australian park reserves.

He says cultural burning is still practised in parts of Melbourne, but largely stopped in south-eastern Australia because vegetation built up in "precarious areas" where cool burns don't work.

"That said, Indigenous people had extremely detailed knowledge of 'dirty country' that needs a good burn," says Associate Prof Preece, now of James Cook University.

Drawbacks of the ancient practice

Cultural burning, Prof Preece says, can reduce fuel on the ground from 10 tons to 1 ton. But it's only effective protection for moderate fires, so it needs to be done in conjunction with hazard reduction burns.

Even then, it only reduces hazards: "With the recent catastrophic conditions of humidity and high winds, nothing could stop these fires."

"Aboriginal people were taken off their country so there's a re-learning process which is very useful and important. But it's still early days and by itself, it's not enough," he says.

Experts agree that cultural burning has limitations, partly because colonisation led to development and human-created climate change, presenting us with a very different landscape now to hundreds of years ago.

Prof Preece has been in areas where, day after day, the conditions for cooler cultural burning weren't right.

"It'd be too moist, too cool, too hot, too dry - you have a narrow window. And with many firefighters in Australia being volunteers, they're working during the week, and you could go four Saturdays till the conditions are right."

For thicker shrub running up tree canopies, he says a hot burn is required because cool burns won't get rid of such layers of fuel.

Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Social media claims that arson was a significant factor in the fires have proved inaccurate

In addition, Dr Thornton says individual Indigenous burns, undertaken by specific agencies such as Firesticks, absolutely have their place, but need to fit within community expectations if done on a larger scale by others.

"We need to ensure fire doesn't escape and burn down somebody's property. It'd undermine community views of the entire practice so we need to ensure we operate within a safety framework which is defendable."

The way forward

Prime Minister Scott Morrison has promised a "comprehensive" inquiry into the ongoing bushfire crisis which has so far killed 27 people and scorched more than 10 million hectares.

When it goes ahead, Dr Thornton stresses the need to "talk to Indigenous elders in each different area and listen".

But he says not a single Indigenous person sits on the board of the national bushfire research centre he manages.

Shannon Foster is keen to work together with government agencies, but she worries about expanding development: "It terrifies me that so much land has been decimated, developers could move in and say we might as well put this estate here; the land is cleared."

"Aboriginal people have looked after this place for so long - to see it now destroyed because nobody has allowed us to care for it is devastating," she adds.

"It's not like we didn't tell you so."

A three-year-old girl and her pet dog have been found safe and well 24 hours after they went missing in Western Australia's flood-hit Pilbara region.

The girl was lost on Wednesday after wandering off from her home on Noreena Downs Homestead, around 70km from Nullagine.

She and her Jack Russell became trapped after heavy rain flooded creeks surrounding her home, police said.

A search involving helicopters was launched as concerns for the girl grew.

But on Thursday afternoon, she was spotted from a helicopter around 3.5km (2.1 miles) from her home.

When the authorities picked up the girl, she was caked in mud but otherwise fine. Her dog was by her side, still protecting her, police said.

"Happily, Matilda and her dog have now been returned to her family," Western Australia Police Force said in a statement posted to Facebook.

Kim Massam, Pilbara's police superintendent, praised those involved in the search, and the girl's dog, who "stayed with her that whole time".

Pilbara is one of the western Australian regions that have been hit by heavy rain in recent days, leading to flooding and road closures.

An ex-tropical cyclone swept along Australia's western coast last week, bringing up to 200-400mm of rain in parts of the region.

What effect has the rain had on bushfires?

Widespread rains across Australia have brought much-needed respite from the catastrophic bushfires that have ravaged large parts of the country for months.

Since September, bushfires have killed at least 28 people and destroyed thousands of homes. The lack of rain has exacerbated the crisis, which has been particularly severe in the southern states of New South Wales (NSW) and Victoria.

Australians have welcomed the rainfall, especially in places where the bushfires have wrought the most devastation.

Firefighters are relieved, too, after the heavens opened on Wednesday and Thursday, giving them hope that blazes could be brought under control.

As of Thursday morning, 85 bush and grass fires were burning across the state, with 30 to be contained, NSW fire service said.

"Although this rain won't extinguish all fires, it will certainly go a long way towards containment," the fire service tweeted.

Storms have also helped disperse smoke in Melbourne, which has endured hazardous air quality in recent days.

Earlier in the week, some players competing at the Australian Open in Melbourne complained about having to play qualifying matches in smoky conditions.

What is the latest forecast?

The Australian Bureau of Meteorology has issued wind warnings for Western Australia, South Australia, Victoria and Tasmania, but stood down severe thunderstorm warnings in the Northern Territory and NWS.

A severe thunderstorm warning for Queensland still stands. On Friday, severe thunderstorms in the state are "likely to produce damaging winds and heavy rainfall that may lead to flash flooding", the forecaster said.

The forecaster said some parts of bushfire and drought-affected eastern Australia could see 50-100mm of rain over the next few days.

It added there was a 50% chance of average rainfall levels between 1 March and 30 May in the country's east.

However, the bureau said more rain was needed to end Australia's drought.

Greg Page, a founding member of the popular children's music group The Wiggles, has collapsed at a bushfire relief show in Sydney.

Page - who used to perform as the yellow Wiggle - sang on stage for an hour and a half before the incident.

"Medics were called immediately and he was taken to hospital where he is receiving treatment," the band tweeted.

The Wiggles were created in 1991 and have sold tens of millions of CDs and DVDs around the world.

Page was a founding member and the original lead singer.

He retired due to ill-health in 2006, returning briefly in 2012 before leaving again. Reports in 2006 said Page had been diagnosed with orthostatic intolerance, an illness related to blood pressure.

Thursday was the singer's 48th birthday.

Medics were called immediately and he was taken to hospital where he is receiving treatment. We will provide more information as it comes to hand. — The Wiggles (@TheWiggles) January 17, 2020 Report

According to Australian media, New South Wales Ambulance announced that a man in his 40s was taken from the venue to Westmead Hospital, and was in a serious but stable condition.

This performance was the first of two scheduled with the original Wiggles cast. It was a sold-out, adults-only performance, with all proceeds going to the Australian Red Cross and the NSW Wildlife Information Rescue and Education Service (WIRES).

Page - along with fellow founding members Murray Cook and Jeff Fatt - left the band in 2012. A new line up consisting of original member Anthony Field and new singers Lachlan Gillespie, Simon Pryce and Emma Watkins debuted at the end of that year.

Several of the group's records have gone multi-platinum, and The Wiggles have won 14 Australian Recording Industry Association music awards for Best Children's Album.

In 2011, the band ranked second in terms of earnings on a list of Australia's top 50 entertainers, making more than A$28m (£14.8m).

Exceptionally low tides in Venice have left the city's famous canals almost dry.

Boats and traditional gondolas could be seen almost beached in the canals as water levels dropped.

It was only last November that flood tides in Venice hit their highest level in more than 50 years, inundating more than two-thirds of the city.

An Italian artist has created a campaign featuring the battered faces of high-profile women to highlight the issue of violence against women.

The posters, which can be seen in Milan, include doctored images of former US First Lady Michelle Obama and German Chancellor Angela Merkel.

Violence against women does not distinguish between "race, class or religion", the posters say.

Artist AleXsandro Palombo says he wants a "real response from institutions".

Other leading women featured in the series, called Just Because I am a Woman, include US Democratic Congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, ex-US presidential candidate Hillary Clinton, Myanmar leader Aung San Suu Kyi and Sonia Gandhi, the head of India's main opposition party, as well as French first lady Brigitte Macron.

Under their bruised faces appears the following message: "I am a victim of domestic abuse. I am paid less. I've experienced genital mutilation. I do not have the right to dress as I want. I can't decide who I'm going to marry. I was raped."

In a statement, Palombo says he wants "to illustrate the drama that affects millions of women throughout the world... with the aim of denouncing, raising awareness and obtaining a real response from institutions and politics."

The contemporary artist and activist is the author of similarly shocking campaigns such as Disabled Disney Princesses and The Simpsons Go To Auschwitz.

Another campaign he ran in 2015 featured doctored photographs of US celebrities' battered faces such as actors Kristen Stewart and Angelina Jolie and pop star Madonna.

   Syria war: Society leaders hold secret peace summit in Berlin

   Image caption A number of people in the room risked their lives to take part in the meeting

Some of Syria's leading figures met in secret this week in Berlin to overcome the sectarian divides that are tearing their country apart.

This is shadow diplomacy, away from the glare of publicity and political pressures, to find a path to peace.

Sunni tribal chiefs, some of whom have their own militias, sat opposite Alawite dignitaries with close links to the Assad regime.

A Kurdish Yazidi leader was next to a former Syrian ambassador to the UK.

A couple of dozen key figures from Syria's most important families, clans and communities gathered around the table, including Christians, Kurds, Druze, Sunnis and Alawites.

They are all leaders in Syrian society who have come here to fight the narrative, spread by both the Assad government and the armed opposition, that ethnic or religious divides are insurmountable.

Many of them are close to the Syrian government - and have flown straight from Damascus - but do not necessarily fully support it.

Others come from communities that are suffering under President Bashar al-Assad but do not back the armed opposition. Some have fled the war and are based in Germany. This is the silent majority that simply wants peace.

"These people see themselves as representatives of nearly 70% of Syrian society that does not side with the armed factions or with the regime or with whoever is waging war in this country," says Daniel Gerlach, a Middle East analyst who is helping the German-based Syrians who organised this meeting.

Why Berlin?

The meetings, which are funded by private donations and European governments, take place in Berlin partly because Germany is seen as a relatively neutral country. The influx of Syrians since the war also means that Germany now has a large Syrian community.

During a break the Syrians chat and laugh over cigarettes and coffee.

Image caption Security was tight so phones were left by the door

The mood is light-hearted. But some of the participants are risking their lives by coming here. Reaching out to other communities can be seen as treachery by both the Assad government and Islamist rebels.

Out of fear of retaliation some have travelled here secretly and participants leave their mobile phones at the door.

Everyone in this room has seen friends, relatives or members of their community killed in the war.

BBC In Syria we don't want this anymore. The more we fight, the more we lose

Sheik Amir al-Dandal, a leader of the large Sunni Arab tribe on Syria's border with Iraq, has lost a brother in the war. I ask him how he manages to talk to people on the other side of the conflict.

"Everyone is a loser, so we need to overcome our wounds. Continuing this conflict simply means more loss," he said.

New pledge agreed

In November 2017 this group's founders first signed a charter for peace, known as the "Code of Conduct for Syrian Coexistence", which contained principles that all parts of Syrian society can agree to.

It included a commitment to equality for all Syrians, regardless of ethnic or religious affiliation.

Since then, more leading figures in Syrian society have signed up and they are using their contacts, influence and social media to spread the pledges within their communities.

After fierce debate, a further commitment was signed on Wednesday evening pledging that no-one would be held responsible for crimes committed by other members of their religion, family or ethnicity. The aim is to avoid violent retribution against a particular group.

People would still be held accountable for their own crimes or atrocities. But their relatives or members of their community or ethnicity would not be targeted for revenge or held responsible.

Image caption Abdullah Rophael signs the commitment agreed by the group

"When we first declared this code of conduct people were criticising, people were afraid," says Abdullah Rophael, a Christian from Homs. He compares this document to a declaration his grandfather signed after World War One that led to Syrian independence in the 20th Century.

"But now it has great acceptance in Syrian society. They are really relying on it to help them be a whole people again after this horrible war."

   Brexit relationship: EU reveals clues ahead of talks with UK

   Image copyright Getty Images Image caption EU Commission President Ursula von der Leyen has said negotiating all aspects of the UK's future relationship with the EU by the end of 2020 would be "basically impossible"

They say an army marches on its stomach. The European Union does it with slides.

The EU negotiating team is gearing up for talks with the UK about the post-Brexit relationship by holding a series of seminars for diplomats from the 27 member states.

The presentations are being published online. Stuffed with jargon and seriously lacking in inspirational clipart, they provide important clues about how things might play out.

Why PD is key

Remember the Political Declaration? Known in Brussels as "the PD", it's the 26-page sketch of the future relationship agreed alongside the 600-page Withdrawal Agreement, which settled the terms of the UK's departure.

Image copyright Getty Images Image caption The UK officially leaves the European Union on 31 January 2020

The Political Declaration is often seen as a lesser document because it isn't legally binding, or as a sweetener to make the divorce terms more palatable.

It's clear that the EU takes the document as gospel because it's quoted at length in the slides. At length. Like it's the law.

EU officials are alert for signs that the UK might be softening on commitments made in the PD.

It's also a handy tool for keeping EU member states in line. For example, some have asked for other things to be added, to be told it's now too late.

So it's worth re-reading.

FTA, you say?

One of the sessions for diplomats was about the centrepiece of the new relationship with the UK - the Free Trade Agreement (FTA).

This presentation was full of the EU's usual catch-phrases about this stuff: being out can't be as good as being in, there's no way to replicate membership of the single market without the free movement of people, etc etc.

Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Barclay: 'Let's be positive' about 2020 Brexit trade deal deadline

In the Theresa May era, this would read like a comprehensive rejection by Brussels of requests made by the UK.

It doesn't feel that way, now that there's a new British government which is relaxed about a looser economic relationship and can live with some friction in its trade with the EU.

But the EU thinks the UK still has to be reminded about what it can and can't get.

And the message on financial services in the slides is unambiguous: "not subject to negotiation."

That's because both sides will use existing ways of monitoring each other's regulations rather than inventing new ones.

A field with no ref, that's the LPF

Get used to another acronym - the LPF, or Level Playing Field.

This is a series of measures to manage economic competition with the UK, which the EU says is necessary to reduce the risk of it being undercut by British firms that benefit from the new free trade agreement.

Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Irish Prime Minister Leo Varadkar said a level playing field was needed to ensure the single market and customs union were "not diluted"

The EU intends that the level playing field will cover taxation, labour relations and environmental policies, and government support for companies, known as "state aid."

The main tool will be a promise not to fall below current shared standards known as the non-regression clause.

But the EU has introduced an extra concept via the slides - "non-lowering".

At first this sounds the same as non-regression but it means that if one party raises standards then there's a possibility they may never be allowed to be lowered again. This goes beyond merely maintaining existing standards.

And the EU wants the UK to stay in lock-step with European policies on the environment and state aid as they develop.

It's described in the presentations to diplomats as an "ambition to improve over time", but in negotiating parlance is called "dynamic alignment".

This is a massive no-no for the British government and will likely cause a big row.

Jointly committed

The EU negotiators think this will all have to be managed and they place great importance on an "overarching governance framework", part of which would be a joint committee of ministers and officials.

According to the slides, one of its big tasks would be deciding how to apply new EU laws or initiatives that didn't exist when the deal was negotiated.

Another would be working out what to do when one side or the other diverged from where things started.

At the same time, the EU would develop its own tools to retaliate quickly if the UK did something deemed unacceptable.

This is at the heart of the deal the EU agreed with Switzerland (but which hasn't been approved yet) and my hunch is it'll be at the heart of what's negotiated with the UK.

Don't forget the fish

And finally, who could forget what access the EU will get to UK waters to catch fish, and British access to the EU market to sell it, billed as the biggest flashpoint?

The slides reiterate that a deal on trade is contingent on a deal on fish. What's not clear is how the two will be linked - either in the negotiation process or in the final agreements.

Image copyright Getty Images Image caption The UK will have to decide if it is going to allow access by foreign vessels to its fishing waters

The EU says it will look at "socio-economic" factors - the real-world effect on fishing communities. That might be surprising if you think this should be a purely technical, environmental matter, but it reflects the importance of the sector in the European psyche.

Another key phrase is "relative stability". This is code for agreeing the broad outlines of how many fish can be caught over a long period of time, maybe decades. It means there might not be much to decide in annual fishing negotiations between the UK and the EU.

There are more presentations and a lot of details still to come. They might seem dull but today's slides are tomorrow's big news stories.

   Image caption Pastor Tibor Varga with one of his basic barrel stoves for migrants

Some 100 people daily are trying to cross into Hungary from Serbia and Romania, in what Hungarian border police see as a new migrant surge.

The Hungarian government has sent military and police reinforcements, including a naval gunship on the Tisza river, to keep them out. Some have been trying to reach Hungary by rubber dinghy.

Hungary has a razor-wire fence along its border with Serbia. It was erected after the 2015 crisis, when more than a million migrants - many of them refugees from Middle East conflict zones - reached Central Europe.

Many of the migrants gather inside the border in the Serbian town of Subotica, where a Protestant pastor from Serbia's Hungarian minority helps them keep warm.

Tibor Varga crafts stoves for the migrants out of old barrels in his garden. This is his third in a day.

Image caption Pastor Varga believes it is wrong to dump people out in the cold

He reinforces the base and thin metal walls of the barrel with old roof tiles, held in place with a mixture of clay and sand.

He scrapes off the red paint, to stop it poisoning the people he wants to keep warm. Then he loads the 30kg (66-pound) stove into his van, and drives it to the old railway sidings nearby.

Image caption Derelict buildings where migrants now shelter: Smoke from a stove billows out of a roof

Serbian charities estimate around 500 men are living in derelict buildings in and around Subotica.

Many have come from refugee camps in Bosnia-Herzegovina, after failing to cross from there into Croatia. Others are new arrivals from Greece.

Those who try to cross into Hungary frequently allege police brutality as they are caught and pushed back into Serbia.

Image caption Inside the squalid ruins where migrants remain exposed to the cold

They emerge cautiously from the freezing fog to greet the Hungarian priest, who sees it as his Christian mission to help all those in need.

Around a fire fuelled by old railway timber, five men cook eggs in an iron pan.

Image caption Migrants burn old railway timber as they struggle against cold and hunger

In one ground-floor room, with a blanket over the doorway and plastic sheets in the window, about 10 men sleep on insulation sheets. They have sleeping bags and blankets, but not much else, only flimsy shoes and clothes.

Another of Tibor's stoves in the corner pumps out a pleasant heat.

But it's a long way to the nearest tap, and the men depend on occasional deliveries of rice, sugar, bread and oil to keep them alive.

Image caption The arrival of a barrel stove brings some comfort

Upstairs, a smaller group of men say they're Syrian Kurds from the city of Afrin, now held by Turkish-backed rebels.

In the crowd outside one young man, Ali, recognises me - we last met in Sofia, Bulgaria, in 2016.

"I made it straight from there to France. I stayed there two years, then was deported back to Bulgaria. I had several months in the asylum detention camp at Busmantsi - now I'm trying again."

Reuters Every day we need to intercept more than 100 people crossing the border illegally; we need to intercept them, detain them and transport them back

A 14-year-old boy describes how, when he crossed the Hungarian border fence a few nights earlier, police kicked him, forced him to walk barefoot, and poured cold water down his neck. Many of the men here have similar stories.

"Hungarian police and soldiers are defending the Schengen border of the EU for the sixth consecutive year, legally and without violence, against illegal migrants arriving on the Balkan route," the authorities told the BBC in a written reply to these allegations.

Hungary has kept a constant "state of migrant emergency" along this border since 2015, when nearly 400,000 migrants and refugees crossed, before the fences were finished. Since then, the flow has slowed to a trickle.

But now hardline anti-migrant Prime Minister Viktor Orban feels his measures were justified - he has always warned that the "invasion" could restart anytime.

"Unfortunately people often care more for animals than for human beings," Tibor Varga said. "That hurts me. These people are desperately in need of help. I hope we can just alleviate this situation with love and care."

   White House 'broke law' by withholding Ukraine aid, says watchdog

The White House broke the law by withholding aid to Ukraine that had been approved by the US Congress, a government watchdog has said.

The Government Accountability Office (GAO) ruling comes as President Donald Trump faces an impeachment trial in the Senate related to the withheld aid.

He is accused of freezing aid to pressure Ukraine to investigate a political rival.

Ukraine has opened a probe on separate allegations linked to the impeachment.

Why was the aid freeze illegal?

"Faithful execution of the law does not permit the President to substitute his own policy priorities for those that Congress has enacted into law," the decision by the GAO said.

The White House Office of Management and Budget (OMB) "withheld funds for a policy reason, which is not permitted under the Impoundment Control Act (ICA)", the ruling continued.

The 1974 Impoundment Control Act says it is illegal for the White House to withhold aid appropriated by Congress. It also says the White House must first alert Congress before it delays or blocked funds, which the Trump administration did not do.

No penalties come with a violation of the ICA. Multiple presidents have been found by the GAO to have violated US laws.

The act does allow the agency to sue to have the blocked or delayed funds released, but that has only happened once in history.

The aid to Ukraine was released in September 2019, more than two months after it was first blocked.

The White House said it disagreed with the GAO's opinion, accusing the agency of trying to "insert themselves into the media's controversy of the day".

Democrats welcomed the ruling, saying it undercuts Republicans claim that the president committed no crime.

In a news conference on Thursday morning, House of Representatives Speaker Nancy Pelosi said the White House "broke the law".

Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Marie Yovanovitch was a key witness in the impeachment proceedings against President Trump

What led to Ukraine's investigation?

The ruling comes as Ukrainian authorities began a criminal investigation into whether Mr Trump's supporters were spying on the former US Ambassador to Ukraine, Marie Yovanovitch.

The former envoy's movements were being monitored, according to letters, phone records, notes and flash drives obtained from Lev Parnas, a Ukrainian-American businessman.

Mr Parnas is an aide to Mr Trump's personal lawyer Rudy Giuliani.

Some of the materials - which House Democrats are presenting as evidence in the impeachment inquiry - show Mr Parnas and Mr Giuliani discussing the removal of Ms Yovanovitch, who was fired last May for reasons that remain unclear.

Several text messages from a Republican congressional candidate, Robert Hyde, to Mr Parnas appear to suggest the ambassador was being tracked in the capital Kyiv.

Mr Parnas was given apparent updates from Mr Hyde on the ambassador's location and mobile phone.

Image copyright Reuters Image caption Lev Parnas is a Republican party donor and an associate of President Trump's personal lawyer

But Mr Parnas told MSNBC on Wednesday that he did not think Mr Hyde's surveillance talk was credible.

"He was either drunk," said Mr Parnas, "or he was trying to make himself bigger than it was, so I didn't take it seriously".

Mr Parnas said Ms Yovanovitch was removed because she was in the way of a Trump-approved plan to prod Ukraine to announce an investigation into former Vice-President Joe Biden.

Mr Biden is a potential Democratic rival to Mr Trump in the White House election this November.

Ms Yovanovitch has called for an investigation into the messages, which her lawyer called "disturbing".

What else did Lev Parnas say?

Mr Parnas told NBC that he was in Ukraine to put pressure on officials to investigate Mr Biden and his son, Hunter, on behalf of Mr Trump and Mr Giuliani.

He said that President Trump "knew exactly what was going on".

"I wouldn't do anything without the consent of Rudy Giuliani or the president. Why would [Ukrainian] President Zelensky's inner circle or [Interior] Minister [Arsen] Avakov or all these people or [former] President [Petro] Poroshenko meet with me?

"Who am I? They were told to meet with me. And that's the secret that they're trying to keep. I was on the ground doing their work," he added.

Image copyright AFP Image caption Former New York mayor Rudy Giuliani has been a central character in the Ukraine affair

Documents show that Mr Parnas was in regular contact with Mr Giuliani as well as Ukrainian officials.

The files also indicate Mr Parnas was directly involved in trying to have President Zelensky announce an investigation into Mr Biden.

One handwritten note from Mr Parnas states: "Get Zalensky [sic] to Annonce [sic] that the Biden case will be investigated."

Image copyright House Intelligence Committee

There is also a screenshot of a previously undisclosed letter from Mr Giuliani to Mr Zelensky, in which he asks to arrange a meeting.

Mr Parnas said President Trump "decided to" withhold military aid to increase pressure on Ukraine to investigate the Bidens' activities.

Mr Parnas also said he told a Ukrainian official that US Vice-President Mike Pence would not attend President Zelensky's inauguration unless there was an investigation into the Bidens.

Mr Trump has said he does not know Mr Parnas. Referring to photos of himself with Mr Parnas and another Giuliani associate, he said: "It's possible I have a picture with them because I have a picture with everybody."

Mr Trump's has touted unsubstantiated corruption allegations against Mr Biden and his son, Hunter, who held a lucrative board position with Ukrainian gas firm Burisma while his father was US vice-president overseeing American-Ukrainian relations.

The matter will be examined in Mr Trump's impeachment trial, which is due to begin in earnest next week in the US Senate.

He is accused of abuse of power and obstruction of Congress but denies any wrongdoing.

Trump gets his Ukraine investigation... sort of

Analysis by Jonah Fischer, BBC News, Kyiv

After months of pressure from the Trump administration, Ukraine has at last launched an investigation. Unfortunately for President Trump it's not the one he's long demanded.

This interior ministry inquiry will not look into the son of former Vice-President Joe Biden or Burisma, the Ukrainian gas company Hunter Biden once lucratively worked for.

It's aimed rather closer to the White House.

Incredibly, Ukraine is looking into whether Trump supporters were involved in illegally surveilling Marie Yovanovitch when she was US ambassador in Kyiv.

At the time Ms Yovanovitch was the subject of a public campaign by President Trump's lawyer Rudy Giuliani and his associates to have her removed.

In May 2019 they were successful, with Ms Yovanovitch later testifying to Congress she was recalled at short notice because of an unspecified threat to her security.

There's been no suggestion that President Trump was aware of any plans to monitor Ms Yovanovitch.

But in his July phone call with President Zelensky he said she was "bad news" and that she was "going to go through some things."

A Spanish billionaire art collector has been sentenced to 18 months in jail and fined $58m (£44m) for trying to smuggle a Picasso abroad to sell at auction.

The painter's work Head of a Young Woman, declared a national treasure, was seized from Jaime Botín's yacht in Corsica, France, in 2015.

Botín, 83, is the grandson of the founder of Santander bank and was its vice president until 2004.

He was forced to forfeit the work. He may appeal against his sentence.

However, he is unlikely to spend time behind bars as first-time offenders for non-violent crimes in Spain are often spared prison if they receive sentences of less than two years.

Prosecutors said Botín planned to sell the Picasso at auction in London.

Any piece of art more than 100 years old and deemed culturally significant enough is registered as a national treasure, meaning owners must request permission before taking it outside of the country.

Botín, who bought the painting in 1977 in London, had already been denied a permit.

He argued that he had the right to take it to Geneva for safekeeping, while his lawyers said that the state could not lay claim to the painting as it had only been in Spanish territory for six months since its purchase.

But Botín was found guilty of "smuggling cultural goods" for removing the painting "from national territory without a permit".

The 1906 piece - worth an estimated €26m ($29m; £22m) - is one of the few painted by Picasso during his Gosol period, a precursor to Cubism.

The artwork is now property of the state and has been given to the Reina Sofia art museum in Madrid.

It can be tricky to predict what Vladimir Putin will do next. Now the Russian president has delivered a surprise by announcing big plans to change the constitution.

Not only that, the government has quit and the country's got a new prime minister.

Just what is Putin planning? The BBC's Moscow correspondent Sarah Rainsford explains.

   Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Putin's plans: What the Russian president's surprise means

Russia has a new prime minister, a change no-one predicted only a day ago. The long-serving Dmitry Medvedev has been replaced by a man most people had never heard of, until now.

Not only that, President Vladimir Putin has initiated a major reform of the constitution that looks like the start of his "transition": a much-anticipated plan to retain influence when he has to leave the Kremlin in 2024.

The details of that plan are still unclear, but this week's surprise shake-up offers curious new hints.

Why did the prime minister have to go?

Mr Medvedev's departure was a shock - or at the least, the timing of it. But it seems he's become his boss's fall guy, yet again.

He's long been a loyal sidekick to Vladimir Putin - most controversially when he kept the Kremlin warm, as president, for four years until the constitution allowed Mr Putin back in 2012. Now he's taking the rap for Russia's economic problems.

The patriotic "blip" over the 2014 annexation of Crimea has faded, and for many families there's no replacement balm for the harsh realities of life. Mr Putin's state of the nation speech this year recognised that, focusing heavily on welfare instead of sabre-rattling at the West.

So he's brought in a new man to sort out the economy, and state TV has been pumping out positive messages. Mikhail Mishustin, Russians are told, is experienced and able.

Image copyright Reuters Image caption The previously unknown Mikhail Mishustin has been named as Russia's new prime minister

The shake-up buys time and goodwill ahead of next year's critical elections to parliament, where the main pro-Kremlin party, United Russia, is likely to struggle.

But it also helps buy support for Mr Putin's bigger changes.

What exactly does Mr Putin want to do the constitution?

Vladimir Putin is presenting his constitutional reform in the same vein as the prime minister swap.

The changes involve a rebalancing of responsibility - slightly less for the president, more for parliament. Mr Putin has explained it as bringing power closer to the people: MPs will get more say in forming the government, for example.

He argues it's more democratic, and will be more effective.

But most commentators see that as masking another agenda: Vladimir Putin carving out a suitable role for when he has to pack up and leave the Kremlin. After two decades in power he has interests and allies - a whole system - to protect. He may not want to bother himself any more with the day-to-day running of the country, but he's unlikely to fade away altogether.

The role of the little-noticed State Council could be central to his future.

Mr Putin is already its head, and now plans to enshrine the council in the constitution. It's just an advisory body for now. Souped-up, it could be a way to continue pulling the strings of power. Think Raul Castro, stepping back from the Cuban presidency, but still the powerful Communist Party GenSec. Or the Kazakh model, closer to home, where Nursultan Nazarbayev remained head of the security council and "Leader of the Nation" for life.

Vladimir Putin could be looking for his way to become Russia's supreme leader.

Can't he just stay on as president?

There was speculation that Mr Putin might simply remove the two-term limit for president in the constitution. Nothing is ever ruled out, but that would be highly controversial even in Russia's managed-democracy.

When Mr Putin and Dmitry Medvedev did their seat-swap back in 2012, it caused giant street protests. There were more pro-opposition rallies this summer.

The Kremlin probably wants to avoid more of the same, especially in a tough economic climate.

Image copyright EPA Image caption Dmitry Medvedev has long been loyal to President Putin

It's thought that Mr Putin is looking for a pliable replacement for himself instead: Putin II. There's still a chance Mr Medvedev could stage a comeback for that role. He's been side-lined, not shamed, after all. It's also possible the new Prime Minister Mishustin could be president-in-waiting. But after this week, Vladimir Putin seems more likely to surprise us.

How or when will we know about his plans?

Mr Putin still has four years in the job, so there's no major rush with the constitutional changes, although events have moved unusually fast lately.

He has set up a working group, 75-people strong, to draw up concrete proposals for the reforms, and has already given them their instructions. Around a giant table, Mr Putin warned the team to take care over "every letter, every comma", as their work concerns the fundamental law of the land.

Image copyright AFP Image caption The newly formed working group is in charge of amending the constitution

Once the proposals are done, his vision should be clearer. Some kind of public confirmation vote is expected before the summer. The Kremlin has ruled out a formal referendum, though. It would be risky.

Despite all the talk of democracy, Mr Putin wouldn't want his big plan - when it's finally presented - to be rejected.

Malta's police chief Lawrence Cutajar has resigned amid criticism over the investigation into the murder of journalist Daphne Caruana Galizia and alleged political corruption.

The announcement came from the new prime minister, Robert Abela, who was sworn in on Monday.

He quoted Mr Cutajar as saying reforms to the police force were necessary.

Caruana Galizia, an anti-corruption blogger, was killed by a car bomb in 2017. Four men have been charged.

She had investigated corruption among Malta's political and business elite, and had made serious allegations against senior government figures.

Civil society activists accused Mr Cutajar - appointed in 2016 - and Attorney General Peter Grech of failing to crack down on high-level corruption.

Mr Abela said he found no reason to dismiss Mr Grech. But he said a new, "transparent" method for appointing the Maltese police commissioner would be examined. Currently it is the PM's choice, not parliament's.

Former Labour Party leader and Prime Minister Joseph Muscat resigned after being accused of protecting his chief of staff, Keith Schembri, and others linked to Yorgen Fenech, a wealthy businessman now in custody over his alleged role in Caruana Galizia's murder.

One of her sons, Paul, welcomed the police chief's resignation, in a tweet.

Mr Schembri has denied wrongdoing. Mr Fenech's arrest also sparked the resignation of the tourism minister, Konrad Mizzi, who was previously energy minister.

Three men - brothers George and Alfred Degiorgio and their friend Vince Muscat - are on trial for allegedly detonating the car bomb. They have pleaded not guilty, as has Mr Fenech, charged as an accomplice.

Germany's foreign office has apologised for tweeting a joke about its visa application process being seductive.

The joke was based on the trending hashtag #SeduceSomeoneInFourWords, where Twitter users come up with four words that could spark romance.

The @GermanyDiplo Twitter account tacked on the hashtag to its tweet: "Your visa got approved."

The joke was deleted hours later and a second tweet admitted that humour was "not always our strong suit".

@GermanyDiplo, which represents the foreign ministry's English-language channel, said: "We know the visa process is complex, and visa decisions can deeply affect peoples' lives."

It added: "Our colleagues take these decisions very seriously."

Many people replied to both tweets with their frustrating, sometimes devastating experiences of applying for German visas.

Law student Mamoun wrote: "When I had barely graduated from undergrad, I was offered an internship with the UN in Bonn, Germany. After an extensive visa application process with delays and uncertainty, I was informed - two days prior to the beginning of my internship - that my visa application was rejected. Danke."

Criminologist Galma Akdeniz added: "If your visa application did not make people feel less than human, it might have been funny. But it does. So this is gloating in your discretionary power, laughing at people who are subjected to it. Not cool, and quite out of touch."

But not everyone thought the tweet was offensive.

Turkish journalist Rahsan Gulsan, for example, wrote: "Even though it's terribly hard and sometimes humiliating to try to get visa from German Consulate, the joke is still very funny!"

#SeduceSomeoneInFourWords has become a popular fad, attracting jokes such as "you hungry? I'm cooking".

Other European government offices have tried to make jokes on the hashtag.

Belgium's ministry of foreign affairs tweeted five words: "Some beer, chocolate &amp; waffles?"

And many people pointed out that France's ministry for Europe and foreign affairs' contribution - "Hi, I'm French" - was only three words.

Two Chinese nationals in their early 20s have been found dead at the site of a 1973 plane crash in southern Iceland.

Police said the man and the woman were found near the Sólheimasandur crash site, which draws tourists.

A police spokesman told the BBC a post-mortem would take place early next week to establish the causes of death.

Officers had not found any signs of a "criminal act" by a third party, he said, adding that the bodies showed signs of hypothermia.

In 1973, a US military plane ran out of fuel and crash-landed on the beach at Sólheimasandur. No-one was killed.

The fuselage of the plane still rests at the site, and has become a tourist attraction.

According to a police statement (in Icelandic), officers were first called to the scene on Thursday after people found a woman's body off a footpath leading to the crashed plane. Officers found the man's body a short distance away about two hours later.

A car thought to have been rented by the couple was found in the site's car park. China's embassy has been informed of their deaths, the statement said.

Jóhannes Thór Skúlason, head of the Icelandic Tourism Association, told Icelandic news site Ruv that his group worked with hotels and car rental agencies to warn tourists of bad weather.

"We have been lucky in the explosion of the tourism industry in recent years, although there are a few events of this kind that we have had to deal with," he said.

BBC technology reporter Chris Fox has been to the site:

For decades, the Sólheimasandur crash site has attracted tourists keen to see something a little more unusual among the natural beauty of Iceland.

The plane is far off the beaten track. A sign at the nearest car park on the main road warns that it can take slow walkers up to two hours to reach the plane, and another two hours for them to get back.

There is a shuttle bus that takes tourists directly to the plane - though like everything else in Iceland it isn't cheap and many holidaymakers decide to walk instead. When I visited in September, the bus driver told me the site had experienced a surge in popularity since Justin Bieber skateboarded on the wreckage in 2015.

But once the shuttle bus drops you off and leaves, you really are out in the wilderness until it returns. As you can expect, the weather in Iceland can be bitterly cold, and it can turn quickly and unexpectedly.

   Image copyright Twitter Brazil's culture secretary Image caption The minister said his speech was a "rhetorical coincidence"

Brazil's culture minister has been sacked after using parts of a speech by Nazi Germany's propaganda chief Joseph Goebbels in a video, sparking outrage.

In the clip posted on the ministry's Twitter page, Roberto Alvim detailed an award for "heroic" and "national" art.

Lohengrin by Wagner, Hitler's favourite composer, played in the background. Earlier, Mr Alvim said the now-deleted video was a "rhetorical coincidence".

Far-right President Jair Bolsonaro said the speech had been "unfortunate".

"I reiterate our rejection of totalitarian and genocidal ideologies, such as Nazism and communism, as well as any inference to them. We also express our full and unrestricted support for the Jewish community, of which we're friends and share many common values," the president said on Twitter.

In the six-minute video detailing the National Arts Awards, Mr Alvim said: "The Brazilian art of the next decade will be heroic and will be national, will be endowed with great capacity for emotional involvement... deeply linked to the urgent aspirations of our people, or else it will be nothing."

Parts of it were identical to a speech quoted in the book Joseph Goebbels: A Biography, by German historian Peter Longerich, who has written several works on the Holocaust.

"The German art of the next decade will be heroic, it will be steely-romantic, it will be factual and completely free of sentimentality, it will be national with great pathos and binding, or it will be nothing."

Goebbels led the Ministry of Enlightenment and Propaganda, designed to brainwash people into obeying the Nazis and idolising leader Adolf Hitler. Its methods included censorship of the press and control of radio broadcasts, as well as control of culture and arts.

In a post on his Facebook page, Mr Alvim, a theatre director who was appointed to the ministerial post last year, said "the left was doing a fallacious remote association" between the two speeches, and that "there was nothing wrong with his sentence".

"The whole speech was based on a nationalistic ideal for the Brazilian art and there was a coincidence with ONE sentence of a speech by Goebbels. I didn't quote him and I'd NEVER do it... But the sentence itself is perfect."

Later, in a second post, he said "the speech had been written from various ideas linked to nationalist art that had been brought by his advisers". He did not comment on the music that played in the video in any of his posts.

Among those who called for him to be fired was the Speaker of the lower house of Brazil's Congress, Rodrigo Maia, who said Mr Alvim had "gone beyond all limits" with an "inacceptable" video.

The Brazilian Israelite Confederation said: "To emulate [Goebbels'] view... is a frightening sign of his vision of culture, which must be combated and contained."

It called for Mr Alvim's immediate removal, adding: "Brazil, which sent brave soldiers to combat Nazism on European soil, doesn't deserve it."

Mr Bolsonaro, a former army captain with a conservative social agenda, has frequently accused Brazil's artists and cultural productions including schoolbooks and movies of "left-wing bias".

Iran's Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei has defended the country's armed forces after it admitted shooting down a passenger plane by mistake.

He said the Revolutionary Guard - the elite unit responsible for the disaster - "maintained the security" of Iran.

Widespread protests and criticism from abroad have put growing pressure on Iran over its handling of the incident.

But the ayatollah tried to rally support as he led Friday prayers in Tehran for the first time since 2012.

The Ukraine International Airlines Boeing 737-800 was travelling to Kyiv from Tehran on 8 January when it crashed shortly after take-off. All 176 passengers on board, including nationals from Iran, Canada, Sweden and the UK, were killed.

The ayatollah called for "national unity" and said Iran's "enemies" - a reference to Washington and its allies - had used the shooting down of the plane to overshadow the killing of senior Iranian general Qasem Soleimani in a US drone strike.

"Our enemies were as happy about the plane crash as we were sad," he said.

"[They were] happy that they had found something to question the Guard and the armed forces."

The Iranian authorities initially denied responsibility but, after international pressure mounted, the Revolutionary Guard admitted that the plane had been mistaken for a "cruise missile" during heightened tensions with the US.

Hours before it was shot down, and in response to the killing of Soleimani, Iranian missiles targeted two airbases in Iraq that housed US forces.

Washington initially said no US troops had been injured, but it later reported that 11 people had been treated for concussion after they showed symptoms days after the missile strikes.

What else did the ayatollah say?

Ayatollah Khamenei, 80, addressed the nation from the Mosalla mosque in the capital. The last time he did so was in 2012 on the 33rd anniversary of the country's Islamic Revolution.

Leading Friday prayers in the capital is a symbolically significant act usually reserved for times when Iran's highest authority wishes to deliver an important message, says Mehdi Khalaji of the Washington Institute for Near East Policy.

Historically, Iranian leaders have left this task to loyal clerics with strong oratorical skills, he adds.

Image copyright AFP Image caption Thousands of Iranians chanted slogans beneath portraits of Qasem Soleimani

As well as defending the military, the ayatollah:

Criticised the "evil" administration of US President Donald Trump, whom he called a "clown"

Accused Washington of "lying" when it expressed support for the Iranian people, and said the US would "stab them with their poison dagger"

Said the Iranian missile strikes in Iraq were a "slap on the face" to the US

Described Iran's elite Quds Force - which the US has designated a terrorist organisation - as a "humanitarian organisation with human values"

Called Soleimani's funeral and the Iranian military response a "turning point in history"

Lambasted the "evil" British government, along with Germany and France, for triggering the formal dispute mechanism over the 2015 nuclear deal

In response, the US government's Special Representative for Iran, Brian Hook, said Iran would remain isolated "as long as the regime threatens the world".

Defending his rule and his government

Analysis by Kasra Naji, BBC Persian

This sermon was an effort from Iran's supreme leader - who has come under heavy criticism in recent days - to defend his rule.

He delivered part of his address in Arabic, calling on the Arab and Islamic world to drive the US out of the region. "The biggest punishment for the United States is its expulsion," he said.

But his more immediate aim was to shore up his government after the Ukrainian passenger plane was shot down. The episode has weakened Ayatollah Khamenei's position at home. There have been protests up and down the country, with demonstrators shouting slogans and calling on him to step down.

Today, the ayatollah accused the protesters of being influenced by foreign-based media. He also praised the Revolutionary Guard for bringing security to the country.

But, ultimately, he seemed to have little new to say. As a result, he is unlikely to have won much support for the policies he has been pursuing.

Many in Iran had hoped the ayatollah would change course and admit past mistakes. That was far from the case.

What about the plane investigation?

Canadian Foreign Minister François-Philippe Champagne is due to meet his Iranian counterpart, Javad Zarif, in Muscat, Oman, to discuss the investigation.

Speaking on Friday, Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau announced interim compensation of C$25,000 (£14,700) per victim for the families of Canadian citizens or permanent residents killed in the crash.

He said Canada expected Iran to financially compensate all the families of the victims.

"I have met them and they can't wait weeks. They need support now," he told reporters in Ottawa.

It comes a day after Mr Champagne held talks in London with ministers of four other nations that lost citizens in the crash.

Speaking on behalf of the group, he said on Thursday: "We are here to pursue closure, accountability, transparency and justice for the victims - Ukrainian, Swedish, Afghan, British, Canadian as well as Iranian, through a full, complete and transparent international investigation."

   Harry Harris: South Koreans bristle at US envoy's moustache

   Image copyright AFP Image caption US diplomat Harry Harris has been accused of insulting South Koreans - by wearing a moustache

As relations between the US and South Korea fray, the American ambassador to the country has brushed off criticism of an increasingly hairy matter: his moustache.

Harry Harris, a retired navy admiral, has ruffled feathers in South Korea since becoming US ambassador in 2018.

But recently, it's his facial hair that has left South Koreans bristling.

To some South Koreans, it evokes memories of Japanese colonial rule over the country from 1910 until 1945.

Those who feel affronted say his facial hair is reminiscent of the moustaches worn by Japan's governor-generals in that era.

Mr Harris, the son of a US Navy officer and a Japanese mother, has previously raised tensions by demanding that South Korea pay more for hosting US troops.

But speaking to reporters on Thursday, he suggested the criticism stemmed from his heritage.

"My moustache, for some reason, has become a point of some fascination here," Mr Harris said. "I have been criticised in the media here, especially in social media, because of my ethnic background, because I am a Japanese-American."

Why the controversy over a moustache?

Mr Harris, 63, has been US ambassador at a time of heightened tensions between South Korea and Japan.

Those tensions were inflamed in November 2018, when South Korean court rulings ordered Japanese firms to pay compensation to Koreans over forced labour during World War Two.

Image copyright Reuters Image caption Harry Harris has been US ambassador to South Korea since June 2018

Then, in August 2019, Japan announced it was going to remove South Korea's favoured trade partner status, deepening the acrimony.

In the context of these disputes, Mr Harris's moustache - and his Japanese heritage - have become more controversial.

In an interview with a local radio station, a ruling party lawmaker compared him with a governor-general of the Japanese government during the colonial period.

That sentiment was echoed by the Korea Times, which last month said Mr Harris's moustache "has become associated with the latest US image of being disrespectful and even coercive toward Korea".

"Harris often has been ridiculed for not being an ambassador, but a governor-general," the paper added.

World War Two-era Japanese military leaders such as Hideki Tojo, Sadao Araki and Shunroku Hata all sported Mr Harris's type of moustache.

But so too did other regional leaders, including Chiang Kai-shek, leader of China's nationalist government between 1928 and 1949.

"In fact, it was a common style worn by a number of regional leaders at the time," Professor Niki Alsford, co-director of the International Institute of Korean Studies at the University of Central Lancashire, told the BBC.

Therefore, it seems this sentiment "is largely down to his [Mr Harris's] Japanese heritage", Prof Alsford added.

Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Hideki Tojo, Japan's prime minister during most of World War Two, sported a moustache

Mr Harris, who was clean-shaven for most of his 40-year naval career, told the Korea Times he had decided to grow the moustache to mark his "new life as a diplomat".

The moustache, he told the paper, would remain unless someone convinced him it was "viewed in a way that hurts our relationship".

On Thursday, he said he recognised the historical animosity between Japan and South Korea, but added it would be a mistake to "take that history and put it on me simply because of accident of birth".

Why are there tensions between the US and South Korea?

In large part, the tensions derive from US President Donald Trump's demand for South Korea to pay more towards hosting American troops on its soil.

The US stations 28,500 troops in South Korea as part of a security alliance to deter aggression from North Korea, which invaded the country in 1950.

Mr Trump said he wanted South Korea to increase its contribution from about $900m (£689m) to about $5bn.

Image copyright Getty Images Image caption A large rally was held last year to mark the anniversary of South Korea's liberation from Japan

The latest round of negotiations concluded without agreement in Washington on Wednesday.

Mr Harris said US negotiators had "adjusted our position, our top line number" and were "now waiting for the Korean side to do the same".

There has also been consternation over South Korea's diplomatic engagements with North Korea.

Mr Harris was rebuked by South Korea's government on Thursday for suggesting that Seoul should consult Washington about the possibility of reopening tourism in North Korea.

Mr Trump and North Korean leader Kim Jong-un held face-to-face talks in 2018 and last year aimed at denuclearising the Korean Peninsula. But discussions have stalled as the US refuses to lift sanctions until North Korea fully abandons its nuclear programme.

   Prohibition: US activists fight for temperance 100 years on

   Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Though Prohibition was repealed in 1933, alcohol remains controversial in the US

It is 100 years to the day since Prohibition came into effect. The 18th Amendment to the Constitution banned anyone in the US from selling, making, importing or even transporting alcohol.

Criminal gangs immediately took over the industry. Speakeasies sprung up nationwide to sell illegal liquor and tens of millions flouted the legislation.

By 1933 it had been repealed - the only instance when a constitutional amendment has been overturned in this way.

Prohibition is now viewed as a failure. No major political parties or organisations support its return, and there is little public support for such an extreme response in the future.

But alcohol remains controversial in the US. The drinking age of 21 is higher than in other nations where drinking is legal. Dry counties and dry towns - where alcohol sales are restricted or barred outright - are dotted throughout the country. And Gallup polling from last year shows that nearly one fifth of respondents said drinking alcohol was "morally wrong".

A century on, a small group of Americans are fighting to keep the dream of the so-called "noble experiment" alive.

"You should think of the Prohibition Party as an exercise in living history," says Jim Hedges, treasurer to the party, which is the third-oldest in the US.

"We're trying to keep the concept alive and the history alive," he tells the BBC. "But as far as getting big enough to have influence, it's not going to happen any time soon."

The US temperance movement, which sought to control or even ban alcohol sales, developed through the 19th Century. Campaigners focused on the perceived immorality of drinking as well as the health effects. Religious groups like Methodists and later organisations like the Anti-Saloon League helped bring about the law change.

Dr Julia Guarneri, senior lecturer in US history at the University of Cambridge, tells the BBC that women's groups - in particular the Woman's Christian Temperance Union (WCTU) - were vital in bringing about prohibition.

"They thought alcohol was one way that money went from the employer to the employee to the saloon, and never reached the family," Dr Guarneri says. Women and children were also victims of abuse from alcoholic husbands and fathers.

Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Women's groups across the country - like the women of Madison, Minnesota - fought for prohibition

As reformers pushed for women's right to vote - ratified in the 19th Amendment, which was officially adopted just eight months after Prohibition took effect - women activists also sought to ban alcohol, seeing it as another way that women were oppressed in society.

"There's more of a connect between those two pieces of legislation than you might think," Dr Guarneri says. "The WCTU saw the banning of alcohol as a way both to keep families happier and healthier, and women happier and healthier."

Worries about the large numbers of immigrants coming to US shores at the end of the 19th and early 20th Centuries - in particular Catholics and Jews travelling from southern and eastern Europe - were another factor.

Some European Catholics in particular brought a beer-drinking culture to the US which was alien to its Protestant populations. But on top of this, both Catholics and Jews incorporate alcohol in their religious rituals. While these ceremonies were still allowed during prohibition, Dr Guarneri says that alcohol "became a way to police and oppress those immigrant populations".

The start of World War I further helped the temperance movement. Campaigners won support arguing that grains should be used for food rather than for beer during the conflict, while German immigrants or their descendants owned many of the breweries.

"So it was very easy to paint a portrait of alcohol being un-American," Dr Guarneri says. "You name it - Pabst, Schlitz, Budweiser... there wasn't going to be a lot of public sympathy for the owners of the breweries from the US."

But Prohibition was widely flouted. Many Americans, particularly the wealthy and the privileged, dodged the law with ease. President Warren Harding is said to have openly served alcohol confiscated by his government at the White House.

Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Alcohol proved to be more popular than temperance campaigners believed

The law grew more and more unpopular. Politicians also missed the tax revenue from alcohol sales after the Wall Street Crash of 1929. Franklin Roosevelt promised to repeal the measure in his bid for the presidency in 1932, and within a year of him coming to office, national prohibition was dead.

Sarah Ward, former president of the WCTU, tells the BBC that Prohibition "probably did our organisation more harm than good after the repeal".

To join the WCTU, applicants must pledge to avoid alcohol and pay membership dues. Ms Ward signed up as a teenager in the 1950s, and has kept that pledge to this day.

She spent decades teaching people about the health impact of alcohol, and says she is proud of that work. But she said the current state of the temperance movement in the US was "very discouraging".

"We can always hope that somebody will realise and a corner will be turned and that'll be great if it happens," Ms Ward says - although she thinks members of the WCTU are "more realistic" now.

"Today, as far as Prohibition is concerned, we will have that when each individual makes the choice that that is the best way for them to live," she said. "We can't get restrictions on anything. Everybody wants to be free and do their own thing."

Prohibition Party treasurer Jim Hedges agrees. Mr Hedges was the party's presidential candidate in 2016 when they took just 5,600 votes nationwide - albeit far more than the 518 they won in 2012, and their best result since 1988. He says the party would like to see a "sea change" of public opinion to allow the return of national prohibition.

"If we were to try to impose that from the top down without having public support, it would be unenforceable," he says. Their plan this year is to focus on states which have easier rules for smaller parties to get on the ballot.

Phil Collins, the party's 2020 nominee, hopes they can get on the ballot in Arkansas, Colorado, Louisiana, Mississippi and Tennessee.

"Four years ago the party was on the ballot in only three states. And this time it'll be five states," he tells the BBC. "So I'm sure we'll get more votes than we did then."

Dry counties and towns, and so-called "blue laws" - restrictions on when and where you can buy alcohol, for example on a Sunday or after a certain time at night - exist across the US.

But the general trend is for more liberalisation. Massachusetts had about 20 wholly dry towns in the year 2000, but several have started to allow the sale of alcohol - albeit in restricted ways.

Image copyright Getty Images Image caption A Rockport liquor license - next to the hatchet-wielding figure of Hannah Jumper

The town of Rockport was dry from 1856, when organiser Hannah Jumper rallied women to attack liquor-serving establishments with hatchets. A referendum in 2005 finally granted restaurants the right to serve alcohol with meals, but it was only in 2019 - close to 162 years after the infamous "Hatchet Gang" raid - that the town granted its first retail licence to sell alcohol.

Jay Smith tells the BBC that after the town's only grocery store closed, the community decided to grant a licence to the first person to open a store in Rockport. His family opened the Whistlestop Market, which sells beer and wine at a mall by the train station.

Mr Smith says the town has been overwhelmingly supportive, barring "maybe one or two people [who] have let us know that they're against it." But ultimately, he says it is a matter of personal choice.

"I think Prohibition was a response to the difficulties of alcohol. Though we sell alcohol, we're for responsible use," he says. "People can have a personal or philosophical attitude against alcohol - I can't argue against that. That's their personal choice and that's what's right for them."

   US officials ground drones over espionage fears

US officials may put an end to a civilian drone programme because of their concerns about the unmanned aerial vehicles that are made in China. The officials are apparently worried that the Chinese-made drones could be used to spy on people in the US.

After a volcano exploded in Hawaii in May 2018, US scientists used drones to save a man from the lava: "Follow the drone," they said. He made it through the jungle.

Drones save people. They also map terrain, survey land and inspect pipelines. The scientists use drones for these and other purposes on a daily basis, and they have bragged about their successes in the field.

Many of the aircraft are made by Chinese companies, though. They are now grounded because of concerns about espionage.

The drones had been deployed for years by the scientists and others at the US Department of the Interior, a federal agency that manages national parks and other duties. But the head of the federal agency, David Bernhardt, is apparently now worried that the drones could be used for espionage.

He is examining the agency's civilian drone programme in an effort to determine whether or not it should be continued. During this time, many of the drones are grounded, according to an agency spokeswoman, Melissa Brown. "Until this review is completed, the secretary has directed that drones manufactured in China or made from Chinese components be grounded," according to a statement she sent to the BBC.

Drones that are used to fight fires and help rescue people are still allowed to fly, she added. News of the fleet's grounding was first reported in the Financial Times.

Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Drones such as this one, an aircraft flown in Los Angeles, look for forest fires

Mr Bernhardt's review of the drone programme reflects a growing concern among US officials about Chinese technology and espionage.

President Donald Trump has spoken in dark terms about China, saying that its leaders have "cheated" the US and that its intelligence agents spy on people here. Chinese officials deny the accusations. Despite the rhetoric, US-China relations have improved.

On Wednesday, Trump is planning to sign an initial trade deal with Chinese leaders. Still, fundamental issues remain, such as the fight over technology. US officials have said in the past that Huawei, the telecommunications company, and other Chinese companies could pose a security threat.

Some Chinese analysts say the fight is not over national security but market share. The Chinese are better at making products, they say, and Americans are jealous. The Chinese analysts see the US policies as a form of protectionism.

The drones are now at the centre of the US-China dispute.

Many of the drones that are used by US scientists are made by a Shenzhen-based company called Da Jiang Innovations Science and Technology Company, or, DJI. The company dominates the drone market, according to a research company, Skylogic.

US officials have in the past expressed concerns about DJI. Agents at a US immigration office said in 2017 that the company's drones could collect information about US sites and transmit data back to Beijing.

Rules and norms are different for private companies in China than they are in the US. Business executives in China stay in close contact with government officials. US officials worry about the information that Chinese drones could collect and what might be done with the data.

The Chinese executives could pass the data on to Beijing officials, explains Sarah Cook, a senior analyst with Freedom House, a non-profit organisation.

Executives who work for DJI say their drones are trustworthy. Michael Oldenburg, a spokesman for DJI Technology Inc, tells the BBC there is no "credible evidence to support a broad country-of-origin restriction on drone technology".

Many US analysts agree with Oldenburg's assessment. "I doubt the Chinese government is using the drones to conduct massive surveillance," says David Fidler, an adjunct senior fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations.

Fidler and others admit it is impossible to know how much information the drones are gathering, however. Analysts emphasise that the Chinese officials pose a threat to the US and that Chinese companies should be banned from certain kinds of work.

"I wouldn't want a Chinese server operating our nuclear system," says Paul Rosenzweig, a senior fellow at the conservative R Street Institute who served as a US Department of Homeland Security official during the George W Bush White House years.

Yet Rosenzweig and others say that the drones seem benign. The aircraft fly over wildlife areas and parks and are unlikely to collect sensitive data. "It is an acceptable risk," Rosenzweig says, adding: "I don't think drones covering Yosemite National Park are a real threat."

The real assessment, the one from the secretary of the interior, is yet to be announced, however. In the meantime, scientists and others wait - and wonder - about the fate of the drones.

Asked if a woman can beat Donald Trump to become US president, Elizabeth Warren contrasted the electoral record of the male and female candidates on the debate stage.

The senator from Massachusetts noted that neither she or Senator Amy Klobuchar have ever lost an election they have contested.

The issue came up at the Democratic debate in Iowa hosted by CNN. Senator Bernie Sanders has disputed reports that he told Ms Warren in a private meeting in 2018 that he believed a woman could not win in 2020.

   The big question Canadians have about royal move

Many Canadians have an affection for the Duke and Duchess of Sussex. But one big question is hanging over the shock news of the couple's part-time relocation to Canada - what will it cost?

There has been plenty of chatter in Canada since Prince Harry and Meghan said they would be stepping back as senior royals and spending part of their time in North America.

The duchess is spending time on Canada's west coast with their infant son as the couple flesh out the details of their move away from their role as full-time royals, with her public outings closely followed.

But the main preoccupation hovering over the royal couple's decision to spend part of their time in Canada comes down to who will foot the bill - especially if they are spending the bulk of their time as private citizens.

Some have outright rejected the idea of the public shouldering any costs for the couple.

The leader of the Bloc Quebecois - a federal party that represents the interests of Quebec, a province where attitudes towards the monarchy tend to be frostier than in the rest of Canada - said Quebecers should not have to pay a dime.

Yves-Francois Blanchet quipped he was already paying for a Netflix subscription, where he could watch The Crown, a drama about Queen Elizabeth II's reign.

He is not alone in not wanting to fork over any cash.

A public opinion poll released this week by the non-profit Angus Reid Institute indicated that 73% of Canadians have no interest in paying any of the costs for security and other expenditures associated with their relocation.

"This view is consistent across demographic groups including age, gender or region or political preference," the organisation said in a release.

Just 3% of respondents told the pollster that Canadians should pick up the tab for security and other necessary costs, and 19% said they were fine with paying a portion of the bill.

The Canadian Taxpayers Federation, a taxpayer advocacy group, says the current debate over who should ante up for costs related to the members of the monarchy is different from those that regularly bubble up in Canada.

The country is a constitutional monarchy - its head of state is Queen Elizabeth II - and things like Royal tours and the office of the Governor General, who is the Queen's representative in Canada, are paid for by the public purse.

"Normally when we get into debates about the cost of the monarchy in this country there's a pretty clear line - people who are monarchists and people who are small 'r' republicans," says Aaron Wudrick, the organisation's federal director.

But the relocation of the duke and duchess has "changed the dynamic".

"The distinction is a bit like a friend who comes over for dinner and you're happy to prepare their meal versus them deciding they're going to move in and still expecting you to cook for them all the time," he said.

"I think that's how a lot of Canadians see this. I actually don't think it's about the dollar figure, it's a general view that people who have a lot of means and the capacity to pay for themselves should be doing it."

The duke and duchess themselves have not said they expect Canadians to pick up the tab, Mr Wudrick notes, and federal officials have admitted it's not clear yet how costs may be divided - or what those costs would be.

Prime Minister Justin Trudeau told broadcaster Global News this week that "there's still a lot of decisions to be taken by the Royal Family, by the Sussexes themselves as to what level of engagement they choose to have".

The question of security costs is "part of the reflection that needs to be had and there are discussions going on", he said.

So while the Queen has agreed to the couple's wish to step back as senior royals, become financially independent and to split their time between the UK and Canada, the details of the transition are still being worked out.

Mr Wudrick says that "in the interests of settling everyone down - maybe this is all a tempest in a teapot - it would be helpful if the duke and duchess could provide some clarity on what their expectations are".

John Michaelson, with the Monarchist League of Canada, agrees answers should come sooner rather than later.

Most Canadians don't spend much time thinking about the Royal Family or their official role in Canada, he says, and the benefits of the institution are often hidden from view - the thousands of community, ceremonial, and constitutional engagements the family and the Queen's representatives there carry out annually across the country.

The league have released regular reports on costs related to the Canadian Crown for the past 20 years "to try and bring the point home that this is something that we get great benefit from and it doesn't cost a great deal", he said.

The tally is approximately C$1.68 ($1.29; £0.99) a year per Canadian for the general cost of the Crown, according to their most recent study.

Mr Michaelson says Prince Harry and Meghan's relocation is also an opportunity for the pair to deepen their engagement with organisations like the Prince's Trust Canada, a charitable endeavour established by Prince of Wales in 2011.

Meanwhile, a columnist with the National Post newspaper said the debate over the likely negligible relative cost of protecting direct close relations to Canada's head of state "has revealed one of the ugliest elements of the Canadian national character".

"It's true, Canada. We're a nation of cheapskates," wrote Matt Gurney.

Richard Powers, with Toronto's Rotman School of Management, told the BBC that Canada could see some economic benefits from having the famous couple in the country, primarily in the non-profit sector.

Both Prince Harry and Meghan have said they are interested in continuing with their charity work, with the duchess visiting two Vancouver-based women's organisations this week.

But Mr Wudrick dismisses the idea that doing charitable works should be enough to open the public purse strings.

"If a Hollywood star or a pro-sports player with a lot of money moved here and they donate to charity and they do good things, they [still] pay for themselves," he said.

   Canada offers funds to families of Canadian victims of Flight 752

Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau has said Canada will compensate families of the victims of the Ukraine Airlines crash.

The funds are designed to assist families of victims who are Canadians citizens or permanent residents in covering related costs such as travel.

Mr Trudeau said families would receive C$25,000 ($19,200; £14,600) per victim.

Fifty-seven Canadian nationals were on the plane when it was hit by an Iranian air defence missile earlier this month.

"This is a unique and unprecedented situation because of the international sanctions place in Iran and the difficulties that that imposes on these families," Mr Trudeau said on Friday.

"This is the first step. These families have lost a loved one in extraordinary circumstances and this grieving is even more difficult as a result," he said.

Families are facing immediate financial pressures as they sort out the necessary funeral arrangements and travel in the wake of the tragedy, said Mr Trudeau. "These families need help now," he said.

The prime minister said Canada still expected Iran to financially compensate the victims' families for their loss.

The Ukraine International Airlines flight crashed shortly after taking off from the Iranian capital Tehran on 8 January, killing all 176 passengers and crew members on board. Iran initially denied it was involved, but later admitted the plane was brought down by a missile fired in error.

Mr Trudeau said Iran has been asked to send the "black box" flight and cockpit data recorders from a crashed jet to France, saying it was one of the few countries with the ability to quickly analyse the badly damaged devices.

He also said 20 families of Canadian victims had requested the repatriation of remains and that the first of those remains are expected to be returned to Canada in the coming days.

Also on Friday, Canada's Foreign Minister Francois-Philippe Champagne met with his Iranian counterpart, Mohammad Javad Zarif, in Oman to press Mr Zarif on full access for officials from Canada and other affected nation to assist in the investigation into the passenger plane crash.

On Thursday, ministers from five nations which lost citizens on the flight demanded full co-operation from Iran in a transparent international inquiry into the crash. The foreign ministers of Afghanistan, Britain, Canada, Sweden and Ukraine also said Iran must pay compensation.

They agreed on five key demands to Iran, including a "thorough, independent and transparent international investigation" and compensation to the victims' families.

   Trump impeachment: Who is Democrat Adam Schiff?

California Congressman Adam Schiff has been chosen to lead the prosecution in the Trump impeachment trial. Who is this veteran Democrat - extolled by colleagues, reviled by the president?

Described by those who know him as "a Boy Scout" with wry humour, Mr Schiff, 59, has kept a low profile over his nine previous terms in the US House of Representatives.

But as chairman of the House intelligence committee, the former prosecutor has become the face of the Democrats' impeachment of President Donald Trump.

As lead impeachment manager, he will serve as a prosecutor for the House, making the case to oust the president in only the third US impeachment trial in history.

"I'm humbled by the solemn responsibility," Mr Schiff said of his appointment. "The task before us is a grave but necessary one."

Early aspirations

Born in Massachusetts to a Democratic father and Republican mother, Mr Schiff grew up in California and later earned degrees at Stanford University and Harvard Law School.

In 1987, he joined the Los Angeles US Attorney's office.

As a young prosecutor, Mr Schiff won praise for his work on a case that led to the first conviction of an FBI agent for espionage. The agent was discovered to have had an affair with a Soviet spy, giving her intelligence in exchange for money and sex.

It was punishing government misconduct in that case which inspired him to jump into politics, his father would later say.

From Hollywood Hills to Capitol Hill

Mr Schiff's career in politics began with two failed campaigns for the California assembly, in 1991 and 1994, before he won a state senate seat in 1996 on his third attempt. Four years later, he unseated a Republican to become the US congressman for the California district stretching from Pasadena to the Hollywood Hills, now a reliably Democratic seat.

His defeated opponent, James Rogan, had become unpopular in part due to his fervent prosecution of Bill Clinton during the Democratic president's Senate impeachment trial.

In 2008, Mr Schiff was appointed to the House intelligence committee, becoming chairman last year after Democrats won a majority in the House.

Unlikely political star

In March 2017, the House intelligence committee began looking into alleged Russian interference in the 2016 election and possible Russian links to the Trump campaign. At the time, the committee was led by Republicans.

Mr Schiff drew national attention - and the ire of the president - after speaking out in the media about the Russia investigation and what he viewed as attempts to discredit the inquiry.

Skip Twitter post by @realDonaldTrump Sleazy Adam Schiff, the totally biased Congressman looking into "Russia," spends all of his time on television pushing the Dem loss excuse! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) July 24, 2017 Report

Mr Schiff's prominence grew after the disclosure last year of a whistleblower complaint alleging that the president had sought foreign interference into the US election. The congressman led the ensuing impeachment investigation, becoming a political star in the process.

'Shifty Schiff' or 'the full package'?

His criticism of the president has turned Mr Schiff into a frequent target for Mr Trump, whose Twitter account is laced with mocking nicknames for the chairman, including 'Liddle Adam' and 'Shifty Schiff'.

Nancy Pelosi, the Democratic House speaker, on the other hand, has lauded Mr Schiff as "the full package". When she named the congressman and the other impeachment managers on 15 January, she noted they were chosen with an eye to their "on comfort level in the courtroom".

"The emphasis is on making the strongest possible case to defend our Constitution," she said - a nod to her confidence in Mr Schiff's skills as a litigator.

Republicans have accused him of pursuing a vendetta against Mr Trump, and echo the president's claims that he is corrupt. He is booed at Trump rallies and lampooned on Fox News.

An amateur screenwriter in his spare time- though his teleplays have so far failed to sell - Mr Schiff has said that he never imagined becoming a household name, although when he came up in a question on the gameshow Jeopardy! not a single contestant had heard of him.

Now, he is poised to step into the spotlight as he writes a chapter in America's most riveting modern political drama.

   Allison Donahue: US lawmaker Peter Lucido probed for comments to reporter

A US lawmaker is facing investigation for telling a reporter schoolboys "could have a lot of fun" with her.

Allison Donahue, 22, said she felt "humiliated" by the comment Michigan state senator Peter Lucido made when she went to him for comment on a story.

His remark was "belittling and it came from a place of power", she said.

Mr Lucido, 59, initially told US media the incident was "blown out of proportion", and tweeted an apology for what he called "the misunderstanding".

Two state senate leaders have called for an investigation into whether his remarks amounted to sexual harassment.

What is said to have happened?

In a report for her newspaper, the Michigan Advance, Ms Donahue said she was seeking comment from Mr Lucido, a Republican, about claims he was a member of a since-deleted Facebook group targeting Michigan's Democratic Governor Gretchen Whitmer.

Members of that group had also posted messages advocating violence against Democrats and Muslims, local media reported.

Ms Donahue wrote that Mr Lucido told her he would speak to her after honouring a group of students from an all-boys' high school, who were standing just behind him.

As she turned to leave, she said that he told her: "You should hang around! You could have a lot of fun with these boys, or they could have a lot of fun with you."

Ms Donahue added: "The teenagers burst into an Old Boys' Network-type of laughter, and I walked away knowing that I had been the punch line of their 'locker room' talk.

"Except it wasn't the locker room; it was the senate chamber. And this isn't high school. It's my career."

What has Mr Lucido said?

On Wednesday morning Mr Lucido didn't dispute the quotes, but told the Detroit Free Press that he didn't feel he owed Ms Donahue an apology.

He then tweeted: "I apologise for the misunderstanding yesterday and for offending Allison Donahue."

Later the same day, he alleged that he was misquoted - telling local broadcaster WDIV-TV that he had actually said "we're going on the [senate] floor to have some fun, you're welcome to join us".

What has the response been?

De La Salle high school, whose students were shadowing Mr Lucido at the time of the incident, issued a statement distancing itself from the senator's comments.

School officials had met the boys who were present to "discuss the improper nature of this situation", the statement added.

Skip Twitter post by @delasallehs Senator Lucido’s comments do not represent De La Salle nor the values and conduct we instill in our young men. We are very sorry the reporter was put in this position and we have met with the boys who were on the tour to discuss the improper nature of this situation. — De La Salle Collegiate (@delasallehs) January 15, 2020 Report

Meanwhile, Michigan state senate leaders Mike Shirkey, a Republican, and Jim Ananich, a Democrat, asked the senate business office to investigate Mr Lucido's comments.

"Sexual harassment has no place in the Michigan senate," they wrote in a joint statement. "We take these allegations seriously and trust that you will take appropriate action to resolve this matter."

Mr Ananich also told the Associated Press that Mr Lucido's comments, and his apology, were "disgusting".

"What his statement, his apology was basically saying [was], 'I'm sorry you realise I'm a jerk, and I'm a creep'," Mr Ananich said. "Leaders in this state, whether they're men or women, they don't act like this."

Ajinomoto, a Japanese company, is not a household name in the West - but a product it makes, monosodium glutamate, is notorious.

Commonly referred to as MSG, the flavouring agent conjures up images of greasy meals followed by headaches.

Now Ajinomoto has launched a campaign to recover MSG's reputation by taking on an unlikely target - Merriam-Webster's Dictionary.

The publisher is being pressed to change "Chinese Restaurant Syndrome".

The dictionary entry is racist and unscientific, says Ajinomoto, and unfairly vilifies MSG.

A campaign video featuring Asian-American celebrities declaring that "MSG is delicious" and urging an edit has helped prompt the publisher to say it will reconsider.

What is 'Chinese Restaurant Syndrome'?

Tucked between "Chinese red" and "Chinese rose", the disputed entry in Merriam-Webster's is defined as:

"A group of symptoms (such as numbness of the neck, arms, and back with headache, dizziness, and palpitations) that is held to affect susceptible persons eating food and especially Chinese food heavily seasoned with monosodium glutamate."

It first appeared in the reference book in 1993, but entered American parlance decades earlier.

The etymology is traced to a 1968 letter that appeared in the New England Journal of Medicine claiming that Chinese food brought forth ailments.

The letter was uncovered to be a hoax, but the myth remains. The US Food and Drug Administration has long approved MSG for consumption, and studies have failed to show that the chemical causes the alleged "syndrome".

What's the science behind MSG?

The flavour enhancer works when molecules of MSG bind to receptors on the tongue that naturally sense the key flavour chemical it contains - glutamate.

Glutamate is a compound naturally found in foods from breast milk to parmesan cheese.

MSG was patented in 1909 by the Japanese chemist Kikunae Ikeda, who gave his invention the name "the essence of taste" and described its ineffable flavour as "umami", now recognised as one of the five basic flavours.

Although anecdotal claims that MSG has adverse effects have proliferated since the mid-20th Century, no studies have established any accepted mechanism for harm.

A 2019 review of scientific literature in the journal Food Science and Food Safety concluded that claims linking MSG to an assortment of ailments were unsubstantiated.

Words and meanings

The comedian and chef Eddie Huang and the TV host Jeannie Mai were recruited to bolster the MSG's cause.

"You know what gives me a headache? Racism," says Ms Mai.

The campaign theme fits within a larger movement to elevate ethnic foods, which chefs like Mr Huang have argued are unfairly seen as inferior to European fare.

Merriam-Webster's has said that it will consider revising "Chinese restaurant syndrome".

   Impeachment trial: Why did Pelosi use so many pens?

   Image copyright Reuters Image caption Nancy Pelosi used pens engraved with her name to sign the articles of impeachment

The US Senate formally received the articles on impeachment from the House on Thursday.

The whole process has been more colourful, and dramatic, than your standard Congress fare.

Speaker Nancy Pelosi used several pens to put her signature on the impeachment bill - annoying Republicans - before House Democrats and the House clerk formally marched over to the Senate Chamber to present the articles.

And the sergeant at arms kicked off proceedings on Thursday with a medieval-sounding threat: "Hear ye, hear ye, hear ye, all persons are commanded to keep silent, on pain of imprisonment."

It's rare to see so much pomp and circumstance in the US Congress, which typically has far fewer ceremonial traditions than the UK's Parliament.

Here's a breakdown of what happened, and what it means.

A 'funny signature' with many pens

Ms Pelosi and her team held an engrossment ceremony on Wednesday evening, where she signed the final articles of impeachment. This is the last, formal step the House takes before it hands over the impeachment proceedings to the Senate.

It took her some time - because she used a different pen for each stroke, joking: "It makes a funny signature."

Reporters snapped photos of four trays, each holding eight pens engraved with Ms Pelosi's name, before the signing ceremony.

Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Speaker Nancy Pelosi signed the articles of impeachment

This is actually a long-standing US tradition - since President Franklin Roosevelt, presidents have frequently used multiple pens to sign high-profile pieces of legislation, so they can be offered as souvenirs and historical keepsakes.

President Donald Trump joked that he was running out of pens as he signed legislation on his inauguration day - while President Barack Obama used 22 pens to sign the Affordable Care Act into law.

Ms Pelosi has faced criticism for using several pens to sign the impeachment articles - with Republican critics saying she appeared to be celebrating what was supposed to be a sombre moment.

Her office, however, argued that while impeachment is "tragic... it is indisputably historic when the Constitution and its balance of power reasserts itself."

Back in 1998, Republican senators also kept pens as souvenirs after signing oaths for the impeachment trial of President Bill Clinton - although those pens had typos on the text inscribed on them, and had to be reissued.

An impeachment walk - twice

Following Wednesday's signing, the House clerk walked across the Capitol, under the iconic Rotunda, to deliver the two articles of impeachment to the Senate.

Image copyright AFP Image caption House clerk Cheryl Johnson and Sergeant of Arms Paul Irving led Wednesday's procession

She was accompanied by the House Sergeant at Arms and the seven impeachment managers.

It was a rare moment when members of the House formally crossed over to the Senate - typically, the two chambers function separately.

The tradition of the procession is thought to go back to the impeachment of President Andrew Johnson in 1868. Lawmakers also made the same walk in 1998, when carrying articles impeaching President Bill Clinton.

"Ceremony and precedence play a role in strengthening the way in which legislative bodies function," Prof Richard Arenberg, an expert in Congressional history and procedures at Brown University, and a former Capitol Hill staffer, told the BBC.

The procession "symbolises the transmission of the solemn document enacted by the House of Representatives, and acceptance of it by the Senate".

When the procession arrived at the Senate chamber, the House clerk informed the Senate that the House had passed a resolution appointing the impeachment managers, and the Senate President, Republican Charles E Grassley, replied "the message will be received".

House Democrats had to make the walk again on Thursday, as Senate Majority leader Mitch McConnell asked them to return to formally exhibit the articles of impeachment then.

'Hear ye hear ye'

You wouldn't normally hear medieval English in the Senate.

But on Thursday, the sergeant of arms - Senate's chief law enforcement officer - kicked off proceedings by announcing: "Hear ye, hear ye, hear ye, all persons are commanded to keep silence, on pain of imprisonment, while the House of Representatives is exhibiting to the Senate of the United States articles of impeachment against Donald John Trump, president of the United States".

Why did he sound so formal? Most of the words he used are actually set out in the Senate impeachment rules, which were developed in 1868 and last revised in 1986.

"This is only the third impeachment trial in US history - a lot of the procedures have come through two centuries, without routine use, so they may seem archaic," Prof Arenberg says.

Nonetheless, he adds, the traditions and ceremonies that have developed help underline the "seriousness" and "sober gravity" of what it taking place.

Signing the oath book

The Senate impeachment rules also specify that when it is the president or vice-president who is being impeached, the Chief Justice of the Supreme Court should preside over the trial.

Chief Justice Roberts had to be formally sworn in, before administering oaths for all 100 senators, who also had to sign an oath book that is kept in the national archives.

Prof Arenberg says it is significant that they are required to take a separate oath.

"This is an additional oath above their oath of office - it's to underline that this is different from the partisan and legislative procedures they normally go through. Even beyond the oath of the Constitution when they take office, they need to additionally swear to offer impartial justice in this trial."

The Senate then issued a formal summons to President Trump, informing him of the charges against him.

The trial is set to reconvene on Tuesday.

Utah Governor Gary Herbert has halted the distribution of 100,000 free condoms in the US state because of racy slogans on the packaging.

It features phrases like "SL,UT", a word play on Utah and its capital, Salt Lake City, "Enjoy Your Mountin" and "Explore Utah's caves".

It was part of a campaign by the Utah department of health on HIV prevention and promotion of safe sex.

The department apologised for "the offensive packaging".

The office of Mr Herbert, a Republican, said that he "understands the importance of the Utah department of health conducting a campaign to educate Utahns about HIV prevention".

"He does not, however, approve the use of sexual innuendo as part of a taxpayer-funded campaign, and our office has asked the department to rework the campaign's branding," the statement added.

In response, the health department tweeted that "the designs did not go through necessary approval channels", urging any organisation involved in the campaign to immediately stop distributing the condoms.

The department stressed that it remained committed to "running a campaign to help in the prevention of HIV" and intended to do so "in a manner that better respects taxpayer dollars".

It had planned to distribute the condoms through a number of health centres in the western US state.

HIV is a virus that gradually destroys the immune system of the infected person.

Although medicines may help to reduce the symptoms, currently there is no cure.

   'Giddy-up', said TSA agent pulling Native woman's braids

The US airports security agency has apologised to a Native American activist after an inspector pulled her hair and said "giddy-up".

Tara Houska was travelling through the Minneapolis, Minnesota, airport when the incident took place during a security screening.

"My hair is part of my spirit. I am a Native woman," she wrote on Twitter, adding that she was "humiliated".

"My braids are not reins," she tweeted to her more than 30,000 followers.

Ms Houska, a prominent activist and lawyer, was returning from a climate march in Washington DC, where she protested alongside celebrities Jane Fonda and Joaquin Phoenix.

What exactly happened?

A member of the Ojibwe tribe, she wrote that a Transportation Security Administration (TSA) agent was checking her braids for weapons as she headed home to Bemidji in northern Minnesota.

But instead of simply conducting the standard check, "she pulled them behind my shoulders, laughed &amp; said 'giddyup!' as she snapped my braids like reins" on a horse, she wrote.

"My hair is part of my spirit. I am a Native woman. I am angry, humiliated. Your 'fun' hurt."

"When I informed the middle-aged blonde woman who had casually used her authority to dehumanise and disrespect me, she said, 'well it was just in fun, I'm sorry. Your hair is lovely.'"

"That is NOT an apology and it is NOT okay," she wrote.

In interviews, Ms Houska said she does not want the TSA agent fired, but instead hopes the agency will improve its sensitivity training.

Skip Twitter post by @zhaabowekwe Going through @TSA at @mspairport, the agent said she needed to pat down my braids. She pulled them behind my shoulders, laughed &amp; said “giddyup!” as she snapped my braids like reins.



My hair is part of my spirit. I am a Native woman. I am angry, humiliated. Your “fun” hurt. — tara houska (@zhaabowekwe) January 13, 2020 Report

Writing for Indian Country Today in 2015, Ms Houska wrote: "Excepting slight trims, my hair will only be cut if a traumatic event occurs, such as the passing of a relative."

Hair styles are known to be culturally important to many Native American tribes. For the Ojibwe people, hair is considered to be medicine, according to Ojibwe elder Larry Moose.

How did the TSA respond?

TSA's federal security director for Minnesota, Cliff Van Leuven, spoke to Ms Houska and apologised on behalf of the inspector and the agency.

Mr Van Leuven acknowledged to staff that a "mistake" had been made and vowed to "learn from this".

"Did it actually happen? Yes. Exactly as described? Yes," he wrote in an internal email later released to local media.

Ms Houska tweeted that she pleased with the outcome.

"Good resolution from a bad situation. We need more education &amp; empathy for one another," she said.

   Andrew Yang's wife says gynaecologist sexually assaulted her

The wife of Democratic presidential hopeful Andrew Yang has said she was sexually assaulted by her gynaecologist while she was pregnant with their first child.

Evelyn Yang has accused Robert Hadden of assaulting her at his New York practice in 2012.

Speaking to CNN, Ms Yang said she didn't tell her husband at first.

Ms Yang is one of 32 women suing Hadden and the university where he practised.

Hadden has denied the allegations in a court document. He was convicted of sexual assault in 2016 and surrendered his medical licence, but did not serve any jail time after accepting a plea deal.

Ms Yang, 38, said she was encouraged to speak out by the warm reception she and her husband had received when talking to voters about their son's autism.

Image copyright EPA Image caption Andrew Yang says he is "extraordinary proud" of his wife

"Something about being on the trail and meeting people and seeing the difference that we've been making already has moved me to share my own story about it, about sexual assault," Ms Yang revealed to CNN.

She said "everyone has their own Me Too story", referencing the global movement against sexual assault, but added "not everyone has the audience or platform to tell their story".

Ms Yang's husband Andrew, a tech entrepreneur who is vying for the Democratic presidential nomination, said he was "extraordinary proud" of his wife.

"When victims of abuse come forward, they deserve our belief, support, and protection," Mr Yang said in a statement on Thursday. "I hope that Evelyn's story gives strength to those who have suffered and sends a clear message that our institutions must do more to protect and respond to women."

What is Ms Yang alleging?

Ms Yang has accused Hadden of assaulting her in his examination room when she was seven months pregnant with her first child.

"I was dressed and ready to go," she told CNN. "Then, at the last minute, he kind of made up an excuse. He said something about 'I think you might need a C-section' and he proceeded to grab me over to him and undress me and examine me internally, ungloved."

During the alleged assault, Ms Yang said she "froze like a deer in headlights" and tried to avoid his gaze, "just waiting for it to be over".

What else has Hadden been accused of?

Ms Yang said she told her husband about the alleged assault after the birth of their child, Christopher. Ms Yang said she was prompted to do so after reading about a woman who had accused Hadden of sexual assault.

Other women came forward and a case against Hadden was opened by the Manhattan District Attorney's Office.

Image copyright EPA Image caption Mr Yang is one of the Democrats vying for the party's presidential candidacy

Ms Yang helped prosecutors to build their case and testified before a grand jury, which indicted Hadden on multiple sex crime charges in 2014.

In 2016, Hadden accepted a plea deal after admitting one count of forcible touching and one count of third-degree sexual assault. As part of the deal, Hadden was stripped of his medical licence but did not go to prison.

Ms Yang and 31 other women are now suing Columbia University, which runs the medical practice where Hadden worked.

The lawsuit argues that the university and its affiliates "actively concealed, conspired, and enabled" Hadden's sexual exploitation.

Columbia University and the hospital system are fighting the lawsuit on procedural grounds, according to CNN.

A university spokeswoman said the allegations against Hadden were "abhorrent" and they "deeply apologise to those whose trust was violated".

   Ayanna Pressley: US congresswoman reveals alopecia diagnosis

US congresswoman Ayanna Pressley has revealed she is completely bald because of the hair-loss condition alopecia.

The Massachusetts Democrat told The Root that she started noticing her hair was falling out last autumn.

She eventually went totally bald in December, the night before Congress voted to impeach Donald Trump.

Sharing the video on social media, Ms Pressley later said: "As a Black woman, the personal is political. My hair story is no exception."

Ms Pressley, 45, is a member of the so-called "Squad" of four progressive Democratic congresswomen of colour.

In an interview with The Root website, Ms Pressley said she first got her signature hairstyle - Senegalese twist - four years ago.

"I was very aware this hairstyle could be - would be - filtered and interpreted by some as a political statement that was militant," she said in the video. "People said: 'People will think you're angry', and I said: 'Well they already think that.'"

Over the years, she said, it became a symbol of representation and power for young African-American girls.

Ms Pressley added: "My twists had become such a synonymous and conflated part of not only my personal identity and how I show up in the world, but my political brand.

"That's why I think it's important that I'm transparent about this new normal, and living with alopecia."

Later in the video, she took off her wig - revealing her baldness for the first time in public.

After the video was published, viewers, activists and colleagues tweeted their support of Ms Pressley - including her fellow "Squad" congresswomen, Ilhan Omar, Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and Rashida Tlaib.

Ms Omar said Ms Pressley was "stunningly gorgeous and a magnificent black queen", while Ms Tlaib praised her "courage".

Ms Ocasio-Cortez tweeted: "Could you imagine losing all your hair on the eve of an enormously public day? And then turning that intensely intimate ordeal to make space for others? Ayanna, you are a living blessing."

Alopecia affects about a third of women of African descent, according to a study published in the medical journal Clinical, Cosmetic and Investigational Dermatology. Another study, published in the Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology last year, found that African-Americans were more likely to experience alopecia than other ethnic group in the US.

The most common form of the condition affecting black women is traction alopecia, which is caused by hair being stressed at the roots.

Other forms of the condition include alopecia areata, which causes patches of baldness; alopecia totalis, which causes total baldness on the head; and alopecia universalis, which leads to complete hair loss all over a person's body.

About 6.8 million people in the US are believed to have alopecia, according to the US-based National Alopecia Areata Foundation.

   Odell Beckham Jr: New Orleans police issue arrest warrant for Cleveland Browns player

   Odell Beckham Jr was named to the Pro Bowl in his first three NFL seasons

Cleveland Browns wide receiver Odell Beckham Jr is subject to an arrest warrant from New Orleans police on a charge of alleged simple battery.

A video appears to show Beckham Jr striking a security guard's backside in Louisiana State University's locker room on Monday after their national championship win over Clemson.

Beckham Jr, 27, is a former LSU player.

New Orleans police said they had obtained an arrest warrant on a charge of misdemeanour simple battery.

The incident occurred at the Mercedes-Benz Superdome in New Orleans.

In a statement on Thursday, the Browns said: "We are aware of the incident and have been in touch with Odell and his representatives on the matter.

"They are cooperating with the proper authorities to appropriately address the situation."

In another video Beckham Jr appears to be handing out money to LSU players after they won college football's most prestigious prize.

That would be in contravention of NCAA rules, which prevent student-athletes from receiving "impermissible benefits" such as cash.

LSU initially said it believed the money to be fake but quarterback Joe Burrow - who will enter the NFL draft next season - said it was real.

In a subsequent statement, LSU said: "Initial information suggested bills that were exchanged were novelty bills.

"Information and footage reviewed since shows apparent cash may have also been given to LSU student-athletes.

"We were in contact with the NCAA and the Southeastern Conference (SEC) immediately upon learning of this situation in which some of our student-athletes may have been placed in a compromising position.

"We are working with our student-athletes, the NCAA and the SEC in order to rectify the situation."

After a three-year college career at LSU, Beckham Jr was drafted by the New York Giants in 2014 before he was traded to the Browns for the 2019 season.

He recorded 1,035 receiving yards and four touchdowns as the Browns failed to reach the play-offs.

   Jurgen Klopp: Liverpool boss says Afcon switch to January is 'catastrophe' for club

   Media playback is not supported on this device Africa Cup of Nations switch is a 'catastrophe' - Klopp

Liverpool manager Jurgen Klopp says moving the Africa Cup of Nations back to January "is, for us, a catastrophe."

The 2021 tournament has been moved from the summer because of "unfavourable" weather in host country Cameroon.

And the Reds face losing Senegal forward Sadio Mane, Egypt winger Mohamed Salah and Guinea midfielder Naby Keita for a month in mid-season.

"If we have to make a decision about bringing in a player, it is a massive one," said the Anfield boss.

"You know for four weeks you don't have them. As a club you have to think about this. It doesn't help African players."

The 2019 Cup of Nations in Egypt was the first one to be held in the summer after the tournament had traditionally been staged in January and February.

The decision, made in 2017, to move the start of the competition to June was widely welcomed, especially by top European clubs.

Reverting to a January start also means that the competition will not clash with the expanded Fifa Club World Cup, being held in China in June 2021.

But Liverpool are one of a number of Premier League clubs who will lose first-team players.

"I couldn't respect the Africa Cup of Nations more than I do because I like the competition and watched it a lot in the past. It's a very interesting tournament," added Klopp.

"But, it's an obvious problem that you play a tournament in the middle of the season, although it makes more sense for Africa to play it in our winter when the weather is better for them - I get that.

"But we have absolutely no power - so if we did say 'We don't let him go', the player is suspended.

"If a player is injured and cannot play for us we have to send him to Africa and they have a look and in one or two weeks they are back. Nowadays, it should not be like this."

'We haven't defended perfectly'

Alisson joined Liverpool from Roma in 2018 for £66.8m

Meanwhile, Liverpool can still improve defensively, according to Klopp, despite having recorded nine clean sheets in their last 11 games in all competitions. The Reds had only managed three in their first 24 competitive matches of this season.

The German suggested that saves made by goalkeeper Alisson and chances spurned by Wolves and Tottenham in recent games have been a factor in their defensive improvements.

"It's just used to getting each other, getting more and more convinced about things and, how I said, luck in the right moment: in life and football, without luck you don't have a chance," he said.

"We have to be honest in these situations, it's not that we defended completely perfect in the last six games [no goals conceded], there's a lot of space we have for improvement, but we knew that."

'You lose the ball and the train starts going'

Klopp also said his team will have to be at their best to overcome a counter-attacking Manchester United side, who they drew 1-1 with during the league meeting at Old Trafford in October, when the sides meet at Anfield on Sunday.

He added: "The majority of the time, we face teams set up like this.

"We want to be dominant, but we have to protect ourselves against this situation. Attacking football only works if you use the full width of the pitch in the attacking half and that makes it dangerous when you lose the ball.

"This game is asking us for perfection. You lose the ball in the wrong moment and the train starts going.

"We respect them totally. The difference to playing at Anfield to Old Trafford is massive."

   Australia fires: Roger Federer, Serena Williams &amp; Rafael Nadal to play fundraiser

   Federer, Williams and Nadal have 62 Grand Slam singles titles between them

Roger Federer, Serena Williams and Rafael Nadal will take part in an exhibition match to raise money for a bushfire relief fund in Australia.

The match is scheduled for 15 January, five days before the start of the Australian Open, and will take place at Melbourne's Rod Laver Arena.

Australian Nick Kyrgios will also be playing, along with Stefanos Tsitsipas, Naomi Osaka and Caroline Wozniacki.

Fires in Australia have killed at least 25 people since September.

Millions of animals have also been killed and almost 2,000 homes destroyed.

Milder weather brought brief respite last weekend but fire crews are again preparing for worsening conditions with temperatures predicted to soar on Friday.

"For a period of about two and a half hours we're going to be showcasing the game, but also coming together as a community to play our part in the relief effort," said Tennis Australia chief Craig Tiley.

Kyrgios is donating 200 Australian dollars (£106) for every ace he hits in events held in Australia in January as part of the fundraising effort, while compatriot Ashleigh Barty will donate all of her prize money from the Brisbane International.

World number eight Belinda Bencic has pledged the same amount for every double fault she hits at the Adelaide International and Australian Open.

"I'm not the best at hitting aces but much better at double faults," the 22-year-old Swiss wrote on Twitter.

"I won't be angry at myself when I hit one and finally they will be useful."

Meanwhile, a group of nine Australian players from the National Basketball Association (NBA) have pledged 750,000 Australian dollars (£392,000) towards the relief and recovery efforts.

Ben Simmons, Aron Baynes, Jonah Bolden, Ryan Broekhoff, Matthew Dellavedova, Dante Exum, Joe Ingles, Thon Maker and Patty Mills are the players involved.

"We are heartbroken over the devastation these fires are causing all across our homeland," the players said.

"Our thoughts are with our families, friends and all of the people of Australia. We hope you feel our love and support and know that we will continue to bring awareness to this crisis globally and provide assistance in any way we can."

   Russia’s mysterious ‘City of the Dead’

  <text>
   Just outside the remote Russian village of Dargavs lies a medieval necropolis fittingly called the “City of the Dead”. This ancient burial ground holds the remains of more than 10,000 people – many of whom lie eternally with their clothes and belongings – and some locals believe that anyone who dares to enter won’t return alive. While much mystery surrounds this graveyard located just over the border from Georgia (even the date of its construction is still just an estimate) historians are gradually unravelling its full story.

Since the 16th Century, this remote stretch of southern Russian farmland has been used as a burial ground; its origins, though, are still unclear. One theory is that when territory was scarce during the 13th-Century Mongol-Tatar invasion, locals living in this 17km valley of the Caucasus mountains began to create similarly structured above-ground crypts to conserve space. Another theory suggests that the City of the Dead was created following the Indo-Iranian tradition established by the migrating Sarmatians who settled in southern Russia and buried their dead above ground to respect the land.

Today, the site comprises 99 remarkably conserved medieval curved-roof crypts with single windows, and contains more than 100 bodies. Some are so well preserved that flesh is still attached to their bones.

This media cannot be played on your device.

The City of the Dead’s story also incorporates another piece of the region’s history: a series of plague epidemics in the 17th and 18th Centuries. There is evidence that infected residents quarantined themselves in the crypts as they waited for death to approach. Some bodies inside the crypts are also buried inside wooden coffins that resemble boats, and one corpse was even discovered with an oar next to it. With no navigable rivers nearby, some historians think ancient residents believed that one must cross a river to reach heaven.

While many visitors travel to this 1.5-hectare cemetery to see remarkably well-preserved medieval architecture, historian Luidmila Gaboeva believes they come away with something more. “The people who come here in awe of the beauty of this place achieve peace with the eternal fear of death,” she said.

   Hideyuki can count on one hand the number of days he’s taken off work over the past year.

“One day in April for my daughter’s elementary school enrolment ceremony; and two half days in November, for a school parents’ day and a recital,” he says. “This is more than I normally take off.”

The 33-year-old engineer, who works for a technology company in Tokyo, had only two days of holiday last year. It’s not because he couldn’t take more: he is in fact entitled to 20 days annual leave.

Instead, like many Japanese workers, taking time off work beyond the absolute minimum is simply not an option. “It’s difficult because the atmosphere in the workplace wouldn't allow it,” says Hideyuki, who has two children, aged six and four, and is reluctant to give his full name due to potential repercussions at work.

“I don’t want my manager to be saying anything bad about me because I took the day off. It is easier to just work rather than them saying bad things about me or being told off.”

   Known for doling out exercise tips and living by the ‘rise and grind’ mantra, fitness influencers on Instagram contribute significantly to the pressure many of us feel to present only our healthiest and most active selves on social media. The hashtag #fitspiration – a hybrid of ‘fitness’ and ‘inspiration’ – has been used nearly 18 million times on the platform by these influencers and their many millions of followers.

Yet while physical activity and balanced eating are certainly important, the dark side to fitness obsession can pose a serious danger to the people striving for perfection. Orthorexia nervosa, or addiction to ‘healthy’ eating and over-exercise, is a medical condition rising in prominence alongside the #fitspiration Instagram fad. Untreated, it can lead to malnutrition and mental health complications, and those in the long recovery process are vulnerable to frequent relapses.

Research from scientists at University College London in 2017 found that higher Instagram usage was associated with increased likelihood of developing orthorexia, especially among followers of the ‘healthy eating’ influencers.

“Fitness shouldn’t mean having to work out every day or weighing your damn lettuce,” says Jen Brett, a recovering orthorexia survivor and fitness influencer.

Hear more from Brett in the video above, and learn about the warning signs of over-exercise rampant on Instagram.
